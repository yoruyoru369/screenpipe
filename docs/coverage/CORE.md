# Core Engine Coverage Map

This is a behavioral coverage dashboard for Screenpipe's core Rust crates.
It is not line or branch coverage. A mapped suite contributes coverage to
each declared platform and layer based on non-ignored Rust test blocks,
confidence, and criticality.

- Manifest: `docs/coverage/core-engine-map.json`
- Tracked crates: screenpipe-engine, screenpipe-db, screenpipe-sqlite-coordinator, screenpipe-audio, screenpipe-screen, screenpipe-a11y
- Mapped suites: 32
- Mapped Rust files: 341
- Active test blocks: 3329
- Ignored/manual test blocks: 142
- Declared test blocks: 3471
- Weighted coverage points: 2728.0

Confidence weights: strong=1.0, partial=0.7, conditional=0.4, smoke=0.3.
Criticality weights: high=1.0, medium=0.7, low=0.4.
Ignored tests are counted but do not contribute weighted points until they
are explicitly enabled in a runtime lane.

## Platform Summary

| Platform | Suites | Active tests | Ignored tests | Weighted points | Layers | Flows | Critical score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| windows | 29 | 3189 | 133 | 2664.1 | 21 | 11 | 100% |
| macos | 29 | 3248 | 117 | 2676.9 | 22 | 11 | 100% |
| linux | 25 | 2851 | 106 | 2355.4 | 20 | 11 | 100% |

## Crate Summary

| screenpipe-a11y | 4 | 2 | 30 | 351 | 31 | 260.1 | 3 |

## Line Coverage

No `cargo llvm-cov` summary was supplied. Behavioral flow coverage above answers
which product risks are represented by tests; line/branch coverage should be
measured separately with `cargo llvm-cov` when the Rust toolchain is available.

Suggested command from the repo root:

```bash
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --output-format json > docs/coverage/core-llvm-cov-summary.json
```

Then regenerate with:

```bash
cd apps/screenpipe-app-tauri
bun run coverage:core -- --llvm-cov-summary ../../docs/coverage/core-llvm-cov-summary.json
```

## Critical Gaps

- windows: no critical gaps in the current manifest.
- macos: no critical gaps in the current manifest.
- linux: no critical gaps in the current manifest.

## Execution Integrity

- Every discovered integration test file in tracked crates is mapped to a suite.
- Every discovered source unit test file in tracked crates is mapped to a suite.
- Both integration and source unit test files are enforced by `--check`.
- Suites with only ignored/manual tests: screen-custom-ocr. They do not contribute weighted points until explicitly run.
- Static counts do not prove a test executed on a given CI runner. Platform `cfg` gates, ignored tests, missing devices, and skipped runtime paths still need job results or llvm-cov data.
