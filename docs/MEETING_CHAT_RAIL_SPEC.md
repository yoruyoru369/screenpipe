The file keeps its `RAIL` name because the case numbers below are referenced
from the source comments; the shape it specifies is a panel, for the reasons in
"Resolved: the rail was the wrong shape".

## Why a panel and not a fourth tab

The meeting view already renders a bottom strip (`note-view.tsx`, gated on
`footerVisible`). It reports capture state, summary lifecycle, save state and
banners — and on a settled meeting with no save activity it **disappears
entirely**, leaving dead space.

A chat composer wants that same slot. They are the same object at different
moments in a meeting's life: **while the meeting is working the rail reports;
once it settles the rail asks.** Adding a floating pill on top of the existing
strip would give the surface two bottom bars and two competing voices.

Decompiling Granola 7.452.1 and Wispr Flow 1.6.531 showed both converged
independently on: persistent bottom composer, overlay never reflow, not a tab,
one resting line plus one suggestion, no "insert into note" button. Wispr adds
one idea neither we nor Granola had: **peek on focus to a small height, and do
not persist that height**.

We adopt five of those six and **deliberately reject "overlay never reflow"**.
Both references overlay because their composer is a foreign object floating over
the document. Ours is not: it is the strip that already lives in this slot, and
that strip is a flex sibling of `<main>` which already reflows the document when
a banner appears. Making chat overlay would mean the rail behaves differently
from the thing it replaces, inside the same 44px — which is the opposite of
"one rail". Consistency inside the app beats consistency with a competitor here.

The cost is real and worth naming: opening a thread pushes the document up. It
is bounded by two things — peek is small, and `thread` only appears after an
explicit send — but a reader whose eye is near the bottom of a long transcript
will feel it. If that turns out to hurt, the fix is a scrim and absolute
positioning, not a second bar.

## Layout

```
footer
├── banners            inactivity · join · capture issue   (unchanged, top)
├── thread             scroll region, only when peek/thread
├── status row         only when footerHasNews             (existing content)
└── ask line           always                              (new)
```

The rail inherits `MEETING_SHELL_CLASS` (`max-w-3xl`), so it sits on the same
reading column as the note. Square corners, one `border-t`, no shadow, no ring.

## States

| State | Height | Trigger | Persisted |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rest` | 44px ask line | default | — |
| `peek` | +152px | composer focused, thread empty | **no** |
| `thread` | +`clamp(152, 0.4·pane, pane−96)` | a turn exists | yes, per user |
| `working` | status row above the ask line | `footerHasNews` | — |

`working` and `rest`/`peek`/`thread` are orthogonal: the status row and the ask
line stack. Status never removes the ask line. The composer disables only when
the transcript is being **replaced** (retranscription), when there is no
evidence at all, or when the model is out of reach — never merely because the
meeting is busy.

# 100 edge cases

Each is `case → decided behavior`. Numbers are stable; tests reference them.

## A · Lifecycle and precedence (1–14)

1. Summary is `running` and the user focuses the composer → **the composer stays usable.** The summary pipe reads the transcript and writes the note; it never rewrites the transcript, so the evidence a chat turn would use is stable. The status row reports the run while the ask line keeps asking. *(Revised after the real-app E2E: the original rule blocked here, which — with case 3's 90s grace plus the run itself — left the composer dead for minutes immediately after a meeting ended, the moment "what did i commit to?" is most worth asking. It was also inconsistent with case 15, which keeps a live meeting askable while its transcript is actively growing.)*
2. Summary is `finalizing` → **askable.** *(Revised again after the real-app E2E.)* Finalizing appends the tail of the transcript; it does not replace it, which is the same thing a live meeting does continuously and case 15 already allows. Blocking here also flickered in practice: the summary status poll moves in and out of finalizing, so the composer enabled and disabled under the cursor — a control that dies mid-keystroke is worse than an answer that might miss the last few seconds. The answer carries the caveat instead, via `transcriptSettling` in the prompt.
3. Summary `queued` but scheduler has not dispatched (90s grace) → same as 1, askable. The grace window is scheduler latency, not transcript instability.
4. Summary transitions `running → completed` while the thread is open → composer re-enables, thread is preserved, no scroll jump, no toast.
5. Summary transitions `running → failed` → composer re-enables. The chip becomes `why did this fail?`.
6. Summary `failed` with a quota error → chip is suppressed entirely; the existing upgrade link owns that moment. Asking the model about a quota failure would itself consume quota.
7. Meeting is `idle` with no summary → chip is `summarize this`, and choosing it calls the existing `handleSummarize`, not the chat. The chip is a shortcut into an existing path, not a new one.
8. Meeting is `completed` → chip is `what did i commit to?`.
9. Retranscription refresh in flight (`retranscriptionSummaryRefreshWorking`) → working, disabled, placeholder `refreshing…`. The transcript is being replaced under the thread.
10. Retranscription completes while a thread exists → thread is kept but a one-line divider is inserted: `transcript was replaced`. Earlier answers cited a transcript that no longer exists.
11. Meeting has zero transcript turns → composer disabled, placeholder `nothing recorded yet`. Matches Granola's `Transcribe a meeting to start asking questions`.
12. Meeting has a transcript but no note and no summary → fully askable. Transcript alone is enough.
13. Meeting is deleted while the rail is open → the whole view unmounts; the in-flight Pi session is stopped in cleanup.
14. Two lifecycle states race (save completes as summary starts) → precedence is fixed and total. For *what blocks the composer*: refreshing > no-transcript > no-preset > quota; nothing else blocks. Only retranscription blocks on transcript grounds, because it is the only state that *replaces* evidence rather than adding to it. For *what the status row reports*: live > stopping > finalizing > running/queued > failed > saving > rest. The two orders are deliberately different — the status row narrates everything happening, the composer only stops for things that make an answer wrong.

## B · Live meeting (15–24)

15. Meeting is live → status row and ask line both render. The ask line is **enabled**; `what did i miss?` is the highest-value live question.
16. Live and the user asks → the send path refreshes the bounded transcript immediately before starting the private session, so the agent sees the durable transcript up to now rather than the snapshot from when the panel opened. The settling caveat still says the last in-progress words may not be durable yet.
17. New transcript turns arrive while an answer streams → they do not invalidate the answer. No re-run, no banner.
18. Live capture is degraded (`isLiveCaptureDegraded`) → the capture banner stays above; the ask line remains enabled but the chip switches to nothing. A degraded capture means an incomplete transcript, so do not propose questions about it.
19. Audio device paused mid-meeting → same as 18.
20. The user presses stop while a chat turn is streaming → the turn is aborted, `piStop` runs, and the thread shows `stopped — meeting ended`. Stopping itself does **not** disable the composer, for the same reason as case 2.
21. Meeting stops normally with an open thread → thread persists into the settled view. It is keyed by meeting id, not by session.
22. Live meeting with the inactivity prompt showing → prompt renders above, rail unaffected.
23. Join-meeting suggestion showing → same.
24. Meeting is live but `autoSummaryEnabled === false` → chip is `what did i miss?` while live, then `summarize this` once stopped.

## C · Composer input (25–40)

25. Empty input, Enter pressed → no-op. Do not send an empty turn.
26. Whitespace-only input → trimmed, then treated as empty.
27. Enter sends; Shift+Enter inserts a newline. Matches `LiveViewAiComposer`.
28. IME composition active (Japanese, Korean, Chinese) → Enter during `isComposing` must not send. Check `event.nativeEvent.isComposing`.
29. Paste of a 40k-character block → input accepts it, but the send path truncates context, not the user's own words. Show the character count only past 4k.
30. Paste of an image into the composer → ignored by the rail; the note editor already owns image drop. Do not compete for the drop.
31. A file dragged over the meeting view → the existing `drop image to add to note` overlay wins. The rail must not add a second drop target.
32. Input has text and the user presses Escape → first Escape blurs and keeps the draft. Second Escape collapses to rest. Draft survives collapse.
33. Draft text with the rail collapsed to rest → the resting line shows the draft, not the placeholder, so nothing is silently lost.
34. Draft survives a tab switch (notes → transcript → summary). The rail is outside the tab panels.
35. Draft does **not** survive switching to a different meeting. Drafts are keyed by meeting id.
36. The user types, then the chip is still visible → chip hides on the first keystroke, and does not come back when the input is cleared. Once someone has their own idea, stop proposing.
37. Input grows past 6 lines → the composer caps at 6 lines and scrolls internally. The rail height does not chase it.
38. Send is clicked twice rapidly → the second click is ignored while a turn is in flight; there is no queue in v1.
39. The user submits while offline → the turn is marked failed with `couldn't reach the model` and a `retry` affordance. The draft is restored into the input.
40. Composer is focused and the window loses focus → peek stays open. Losing OS focus is not intent to close.

## D · Suggestions and the chip (41–48)

41. Peek opens with an empty thread → 3 suggestion rows. Non-empty thread → none.
42. Suggestions appear with the rail, carrying **no opacity animation of their own.** *(Revised after the real-app E2E.)* This originally borrowed Wispr's asymmetric entrance — fade in after 240ms, leave at 0ms — and shipped as an invisible feature: `fill-mode-both` holds the element at the keyframe's opacity 0 through the delay, and when the `enter` animation does not actually run, the backwards fill pins it there permanently. The suggestions were present in the DOM and transparent in the packaged app, which is exactly why an existence assertion passed while nobody could see them. The disclosure is carried by the rail's height transition, which is real and visible. A flourish that can silently hide the content it decorates is not worth keeping.
43. Clicking a suggestion fills the input and sends in one action. It does not just prefill — a two-step suggestion is a worse button.
44. Suggestion set is chosen by meeting state, matching the chip table. Live gets `what did i miss? / who has spoken most? / what was just decided?`.
45. A suggestion is clicked while a turn is streaming → ignored, same as 38.
46. Chip label exceeds the available width → it is hidden, not truncated. A truncated suggestion is not a suggestion. Threshold mirrors Granola's 24-character gate.
47. Window narrower than 480px → chip hidden, suggestions become 2 rows.
48. `prefers-reduced-motion` → all height and fade transitions collapse to 0ms; state changes are instant.

## E · Geometry (49–62)

49. Pane shorter than 300px → thread clamps to `pane − 96` and the peek height is skipped entirely; focus goes straight from rest to the clamped thread.
50. Thread is open and the window is resized smaller → height re-clamps on resize, never exceeding `pane − 96`.
51. Thread is open and the window is resized larger → the persisted height is restored up to the new clamp, not stretched.
52. User drags the thread taller than the pane → clamped. The drag does not scroll the document behind.
53. User drags the thread below 152px → snaps closed to rest, and the persisted height is left at its last valid value.
54. Peek height is never written to preferences, so a peek-then-escape leaves the user's chosen thread height intact.
55. Rail must never cover the last line of the note. Because the rail reflows rather than overlays, this is structural: `<main>` is `flex-1` and the footer is `shrink-0`, so the document is always sized against the rail's current height.
56. The transcript tab is scrolled to the bottom and the rail opens → the pane shrinks, and the tab's own scroll container keeps its offset. The rail does not force a scroll.
57. Rail opens while the summary is streaming into the summary tab → the streaming surface keeps its own scroll; the rail does not steal it.
58. Very long single-word input (a URL) → wraps with `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, does not widen the rail.
59. A code block in an answer → scrolls horizontally inside its own container. The rail never scrolls sideways.
60. An answer with a 30-row table → same; the rail's scroll region owns vertical, the block owns horizontal.
61. Rail at rest is exactly `h-11` so it aligns with `MEETING_RULE_ACTION_CLASS` on the tab rule above.
62. Sub-pixel rounding on fractional-DPI displays must not produce a 1px gap between the rail's top border and the pane. Use a single `border-t`, never two adjacent borders.

## F · Send, streaming, agent (63–78)

63. `piStart` fails → the turn fails immediately with the transport error, not a generic message.
64. `piStart` succeeds but `piPrompt` fails → retry `piStart` once, mirroring `use-pi-send-transport`.
65. The agent emits a tool call outside the read-only meeting allowlist → the run is killed, as in `generate-live-view-with-pi.ts`. The thread shows `stopped — unexpected tool`. An explicit request to check broader screenpipe history may use the allowlisted `search-content`/`keyword-search`, `get-meeting`, or `frame-context` tools; ordinary meeting questions never widen scope silently.

    Tool identity is compared *normalized*, not literally. The same tool reaches
    the panel under three spellings — bare (`search-content`) from raw Pi,
    `mcp__screenpipe__search-content` from a stdio ACP agent, and
    `mcp__screenpipe-tools__frame_context` from an http-only one (Cursor,
    Copilot) — and matching only the bare form killed every ACP turn on its first
    tool call, including calls to the allowlisted tool itself.

    Two classes are deliberately **not** killed: an `mcp__<server>__startup`
    diagnostic (emitted per unreachable MCP server on every turn, never a tool
    the agent chose), and a read-only native agent step. ACP harnesses always
    carry native tools and cannot be told to drop them, so a `read`/`search`
    step must not cost the user an answer; native steps whose ACP `kind` is
    `edit`, `delete`, `move`, `execute`, or `fetch` — and known action tools when
    an adapter sends no kind — still kill the run.

    Enforcement is layered, because the client gate only fires *after* a tool has
    started. The session is spawned scoped: raw Pi gets `--tools`, and ACP gets
    `SCREENPIPE_ACP_TOOL_ALLOWLIST`, under which the runtime mounts no
    third-party MCP servers, injects no shared screenpipe agent context, and
    answers a permission request for a non-allowlisted tool with a refusal
    instead of waiting on an approval card this panel has no UI to show. Before
    that scoping the panel inherited the user's own MCP servers and the shared
    context that advertises skills, which is what made an agent reach for a skill
    and lose its turn.
66. The agent emits no text and terminates → `no answer` plus `retry`, never a blank turn.
67. The agent streams `text_end` without `text_delta` → the renderer must fold both. Pipe agents emit `text_end` only; a delta-only reader shows nothing.
68. Turn exceeds 90s → aborted with a timeout, matching `GENERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`.
69. The session is evicted by the bus → the thread marks the turn failed and does not silently hang.
70. Two meetings are open in two windows and both chat → each mints its own private session id; they must not collide. Session id embeds the meeting id.
71. Hosted AI quota is exhausted → composer disabled, placeholder `ai limit reached`, upgrade action if eligible. Same predicate as `LiveViewAiComposer`.
72. No AI preset is configured → composer disabled with `set up ai in settings`; the compact model control remains available to choose or create one. Do not send to nothing.
73. The selected preset is a local model that is not running → the transport error surfaces verbatim.
74. The user closes the meeting while a turn streams → cleanup runs `piStop`; no orphan process.
75. The app quits mid-turn → the session is not resumed on next launch. Threads persist, in-flight turns do not.
76. The transcript exceeds the context budget → it is windowed, and the answer states which window it saw. Never silently truncate.
77. Screen frames or broader screenpipe history are included only when the user explicitly asks for them or the question requires visual meeting evidence, using the smallest relevant time range. The answer distinguishes that evidence from the attached meeting transcript and notes.
78. The agent returns markdown with an image reference → images are stripped in the thread. The thread is text; the note is where media lives.

## G · Citations (79–86)

79. An answer contains `3:34` in the meeting's time range → rendered as a link.
80. An answer contains a time outside the meeting's range → rendered as plain text. A citation that cannot resolve is not a citation.
81. Clicking a citation switches to the transcript tab and scrolls that turn into view, reusing `transcript-highlight.ts`.
82. Clicking a citation when the transcript has not loaded → switch tabs, then scroll once loaded. Do not drop the intent.
83. A citation whose turn was removed by retranscription → the tab switches, and a toast says `that turn is no longer in the transcript`.
84. Two citations to the same timestamp → both link; no dedupe. They are separate claims.
85. A malformed timestamp (`25:99`) → plain text.
86. Citations are parsed from rendered text, never from raw markdown, so a `3:34` inside a code fence is not linkified.

## H · Persistence and windows (87–92)

87. Thread is stored per meeting id under `~/.screenpipe/`, alongside the existing chat storage convention.
88. The same meeting is open in the home window and the standalone window → both render the thread; a turn sent in one appears in the other. Reuse the existing cross-window event pattern.
89. Both windows send simultaneously → the second is rejected by the same in-flight guard as 38, scoped to the meeting not the window.
90. Thread history is capped at 50 turns per meeting; older turns are dropped from memory but kept on disk.
91. Corrupt thread file on disk → the rail starts empty rather than throwing. A broken thread must not break the meeting view.
92. Persisted thread height is out of range for the current display → clamped on read.

## I · Accessibility (93–100)

93. The rail is a `<form>` with an accessible name `ask about this meeting`, so screen readers announce it as one region.
94. State changes announce via `aria-live="polite"` on the status row only — not the streaming answer, which would read every token.
95. The completed answer is announced once, on turn end.
96. Tab order is: note content → tabs → rail input → send. The rail is last so keyboard users are not trapped before the document.
97. Escape must not bubble out of the rail and close a parent dialog. Stop propagation, as Granola does.
98. Suggestions are `<button>` elements in a list, reachable by Tab and operable by Enter and Space.
99. Focus ring uses the existing `ring-1 ring-inset ring-foreground` idiom from `MEETING_RULE_ACTION_CLASS`; it must be visible on both themes.
100. Every state must be reachable and legible with `prefers-reduced-motion`, at 200% zoom, and in forced-colors mode — which is why the rail encodes state in layout and copy, never in color alone.

## Out of scope for the first PR

Deliberately cut, with reasons:

- **A fourth tab.** Chat is a lens over notes/transcript/summary, not a peer of them; a tab would hide the thing being asked about.
- **Thread switcher, new chat.** One thread per meeting, like the note and the summary. Meetings are bounded.
- **Attachments and `@`-mentions.** The attached meeting remains the visible primary context. Explicit read-only history searches do not turn the rail into a second general-purpose composer.
- **"Insert into note".** Neither reference app shipped it. A later PR gives the agent one write tool plus a receipt and an undo.
- **Rounded pills and shadows.** The meeting view is `rounded-none` and flat.

## Measured footprint

Taken from the E2E geometry probe in a 860px-tall window, so these are real
numbers rather than the intended ones:

| state | footer height | share of window |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rest | 125px | 14.5% |
| peek | 297px | 34.5% |

Rest is the cost of the feature and it is defensible: one status row, one ask
line. Peek is not obviously defensible. Focusing the composer takes 172px away
from the document to show three lines of text, and the resting chip already
answers "what can i ask?" in 0px of extra height.

Peek buys one thing rest does not: it says "this is a conversation, not a search
box" before anything is sent. That is a real job, but three stacked suggestions
is an expensive way to do it. The cheaper shape is Granola's: suggestions as
chips *on* the resting line, sized to the width available, so the ladder is rest
→ thread with no middle rung.

This is recorded rather than acted on because cutting a rung changes what the
feature is, not how it is built.

### Resolved: the rail was the wrong shape

Acted on. The objection that settled it was simpler than the footprint numbers:
notes and summary have **no footer at all** today, so a docked rail was new
permanent chrome on two surfaces that were clean, and it appeared whether or not
anyone ever asked anything.

The deeper error was which axis it spent. The meeting view is a width-capped
reading column: the horizontal axis has slack sitting unused in the margins, the
vertical axis has none, and the rail took the one the document needs.

Granola was also read wrong here. Its in-note chat is not a bottom line. It is
`<aside id="multi-chat-sidebar">`, `w-80` overlaying a narrow window and
`@5xl/view:w-96` docked in a wide one, resizable from its left edge. The
bottom-anchored `floating-chat-panel` found in the same bundle belongs to the
full-screen chat view, not the note. An earlier draft of this document
generalised from that panel without checking which surface it mounted on.

What the panel changes:

| | rail | panel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| axis | height | width |
| resting cost | 125px on every tab | nothing rendered |
| open cost | 297px of document | 0px of document height |
| narrow window | shrinks the document further | overlays it |
| entry | always present | one control on the tab rule |

The rungs `rest` and `peek` are gone with it. Peek's entire content was three
suggestions, which the panel shows in space the document was never using, so the
ladder is now closed → open. Case numbers below still hold; where they say
"height" read "width", and where they say "rail" read "panel".
