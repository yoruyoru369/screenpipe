# Fast native development builds

<!-- doc-covers: none -->

There are exactly four normal native-development commands. Run them from
`apps/screenpipe-app-tauri`:

```bash
# Live frontend + native app loop.
bun run dev:tauri

# One-shot native test binary, without packaging an installer or app bundle.
bun run build:tauri:dev

# E2E-capable one-shot test binary.
bun run build:tauri:e2e

# Native app tests; append ordinary cargo-test filters and flags.
bun run test:tauri activity_history::tests
```

The Tauri build scripts pass the named profile as Cargo runner arguments:
`-- --profile debug-dev`; the native-test command passes the same profile
directly to Cargo. The space-separated Tauri form matters. It makes Tauri
2.11.2 select `src-tauri/target/debug-dev`; `--debug` instead selects Cargo's
built-in `dev` profile.

Do not add `cargo clean`, a shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, incremental/profile
environment overrides, or one-off compiler-cache settings. The checked-in
`debug-dev` profile is the single source of truth: no first-party debuginfo,
high parallel codegen, and no per-worktree incremental state.

## System-wide build queue and cache

The four commands above and the signed build script all use one per-user build
slot on macOS. A second worktree waits instead of starting another cold native
compile on the same CPU. Queue output names the current build, PID, worktree,
and wait time; inspect it directly with:

```bash
bun run build:tauri:status
```

The coordinator keeps each worktree's own `src-tauri/target` directory so
concurrent checkouts cannot corrupt one another. It configures the existing
machine-wide sccache server with every live Screenpipe worktree as a base
directory. Eligible dependency objects can therefore be reused across
worktrees without sharing target directories. The worktree list is refreshed
before every queued native build. Do not point a second sccache server at the
same local cache directory; sccache local storage supports only one server.

Never run raw `cargo` or Tauri commands against `src-tauri`. They bypass the
system lock; a later queued build may legitimately restart sccache while
refreshing its worktree bases, causing the unqueued build to compile locally.
If the queue or cache is unavailable, stop instead of accepting that fallback.

`bun run dev:tauri` queues only its initial Cargo warm-up. It releases the build
slot before starting the long-running Tauri dev process, so an open app does not
block every later build. Subsequent hot-reload compiles belong to that live dev
session and are not queued.

For React/layout-only work, `bun run dev:web` is still faster because it avoids
Rust entirely.

## macOS permissions

Signing is separate from the normal build loop. Only create a signed `.app`
when the test specifically needs a stable macOS TCC identity across rebuilds:

```bash
apps/screenpipe-app-tauri/scripts/build_macos.sh
```

That script enters the same system build queue, uses the same `debug-dev`
profile, builds only the macOS app bundle, and signs it with its configured
development identity. Set
`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` to use a different stable certificate. Normal
development builds should not copy its packaging/signing steps; otherwise use
the development commands above.
