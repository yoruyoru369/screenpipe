# contributing to screen pipe

first off, thank you for considering contributing to screen pipe!

btw, we prefer that you don't contribute if you are not using or will use the product and is just there for bounties, thank you.

## getting started

before you begin:
- try to run the [pre-built app](https://docs.screenpi.pe) to get familiar with the project
- familiarize yourself with the repository structure and architecture.
- new to contributing? the [beginner's onboarding guide](ONBOARDING.md) walks you from zero to a merged pr step by step (this file is the reference; that one is the walkthrough).

## installation and build guide

### macos

1. **install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   brew install pkg-config ffmpeg jq cmake wget git-lfs
   ```
   Install Xcode via App Store (or elsewhere) and initialize. Xcode command line tools only installation is insufficent. 
   ```
   sudo xcodebuild -license
   xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
   ```

2. **install bun cli**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```

3. **clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/screenpipe/screenpipe
   cd screenpipe
   ```

4. **build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release --features metal
   ```

5. **run screenpipe**:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/screenpipe
   ```

6. **build the desktop app**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/screenpipe-app-tauri
   bun install
   bun run build:tauri:dev
   ```

#### sharing downloaded dependencies across worktrees

The desktop prebuild keeps immutable native downloads such as FFmpeg, FFprobe,
the Bun sidecars, MLX metallib, and Windows OpenBLAS in a machine-wide cache.
The default is `~/.cache/screenpipe/native-deps`. To put it elsewhere, set the
same absolute path in every worktree environment:

```bash
export SCREENPIPE_NATIVE_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/screenpipe/native-deps"
export SCREENPIPE_FRONTEND_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/screenpipe/frontend-out"
```

Cache entries are versioned, validated, and protected by per-artifact locks, so
concurrent worktree builds download each artifact at most once. Set either
variable to `off` to disable that cache. Keep Cargo's `target` directory local
to each worktree when running concurrent builds; do not set a shared
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.

### windows

These steps build the local NSIS installer (`*-setup.exe`). The default Tauri
configuration intentionally produces `screenpipe - Development`, which can live
next to the released app without taking over its identity or updater settings.

1. **install winget**:
   - `winget` ships with App Installer on current Windows 10 and Windows 11. If
     the command is missing, follow the [official Windows Package Manager
     installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/).

2. **install the required tools**:
   ```powershell
   winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override "--wait --passive --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"
   winget install -e --id Rustlang.Rustup
   winget install -e --id LLVM.LLVM
   winget install -e --id Kitware.CMake
   winget install -e --id Git.Git
   winget install -e --id 7zip.7zip
   irm https://bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex
   ```

   The Visual Studio package alone is not enough: Tauri needs the **Desktop
   development with C++** workload. The `--override` above installs that workload,
   including MSVC and a Windows SDK. This is also the workload named in the
   [official Tauri Windows prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#windows).

   Close and reopen PowerShell after the installers finish so the new commands
   are on `PATH`.

3. **configure and verify the toolchain**:
   ```powershell
   $llvmBin = 'C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin'
   $env:LIBCLANG_PATH = $llvmBin
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('LIBCLANG_PATH', $llvmBin, 'User')

   bun --version
   cargo --version
   cmake --version
   if (-not (Test-Path "$env:LIBCLANG_PATH\libclang.dll")) { throw 'libclang.dll not found' }

   $vswhere = "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe"
   if (-not (& $vswhere -latest -products * -requires Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64 -property installationPath)) {
     throw 'install the Visual Studio Desktop development with C++ workload'
   }
   ```

   Setting the user environment variable only affects future terminals, so the
   `$env:LIBCLANG_PATH` assignment is required for the current one.

4. **clone the project**:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/screenpipe/screenpipe.git
   cd screenpipe
   ```

5. **build the Tauri installer**:
   ```powershell
   cd apps/screenpipe-app-tauri
   bun install --frozen-lockfile
   bun tauri build
   ```

   Do not run the repository-root `cargo build --release` first unless you also
   need the standalone CLI. The desktop app is a separate Cargo workspace with
   its own `src-tauri/target` directory, so the root build does not warm this
   build and makes a fresh setup substantially slower.

6. **find the installer**:
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem .\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\*-setup.exe
   ```

#### what to expect from a fresh windows worktree

- The first `bun tauri build` runs the frontend build and `scripts/pre_build.js`
  automatically. The prebuild downloads and extracts FFmpeg and OpenBLAS, copies
  the Bun sidecar and Visual C++ runtime DLLs, then Cargo compiles the native app.
  You do not need to run the prebuild separately.
- Plan for at least 10 GB of free disk space. In a clean x64 worktree the app-local
  Cargo target alone can exceed 5 GB; `node_modules`, sidecars, and global Cargo
  caches need additional space.
- A fresh Git worktree shares Git objects, the global Cargo registry, and the
  machine-wide native/frontend caches, but not `node_modules` or
  `src-tauri/target`. The native files are restored from cache without another
  download. Cargo compilation, relinking, and installer compression remain
  worktree-local and can still take several minutes.
- `failed to get npm global prefix` is a non-fatal Bun-discovery fallback when it
  is immediately followed by `found bun` and `bun binary copied successfully`.
- The local development installer is unsigned. Official Windows release builds
  are Authenticode-signed in the release workflow, but a local build without the
  release certificate is expected to report `NotSigned`.
- `Microsoft VC143/144/145 CRT not found` means the Visual Studio C++ workload is
  missing. A `libclang.dll` or bindgen error usually means `LIBCLANG_PATH` is not
  set in the current terminal.

### linux

1. **install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y g++ ffmpeg tesseract-ocr cmake libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev libssl-dev libtesseract-dev libxdo-dev libsdl2-dev libclang-dev libxtst-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **install bun cli**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```

3. **install vulkan dependencies (optional, for AMD GPU acceleration)**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y libvulkan-dev glslc
   ```

4. **clone and build**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/screenpipe/screenpipe
   cd screenpipe
   cargo build --release
   ```

5. **run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/screenpipe
   ```

6. **build the desktop app**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y libayatana-appindicator3-1 libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev
   cd apps/screenpipe-app-tauri
   bun install
   bun tauri build
   ```

### docker

[check out the docker setup here](https://github.com/sabrehagen/desktop-environment/blob/730a3134362927f8965589f6322b4554e0a5e388/docker/Dockerfile#L403)

## how can i contribute?

### ai-assisted contributions

ai assistance is welcome, but every outside contribution needs an accountable
human driver. these rules apply to issues, pull requests, review comments, and
replies to maintainers:

- disclose the AI tool used, its autonomy level (`autocomplete`, `chat`, or
  `agent`), and exactly what you personally verified. write `none` when no AI
  tool was used.
- do not use an autonomous agent to submit an outside issue, pull request, or
  comment. the accountable contributor must personally make the submission.
- write the problem statement, rationale, and replies to maintainers in your
  own words. AI may help construct tests and reproductions, but it must not
  impersonate you.
- understand and be able to explain every material change. do not ask a model
  to answer maintainers on your behalf.
- never claim manual testing you did not perform. include the exact commands
  and results, plus real end-to-end evidence where applicable.
- provide evidence appropriate to the change:
  - UI or behavior changes: a before/after recording.
  - backend changes: regression tests and relevant logs or results.
  - performance changes: reproducible before/after benchmarks.
  - docs, CI, and pure refactors: the relevant checks and an explanation; do
    not fabricate a video.
- do not submit unsolicited LLM-generated reviews of another contributor's
  pull request.

use `autocomplete` when AI only supplied inline completions, `chat` when you
asked for suggestions or code and chose what to apply, and `agent` when AI
planned or executed multi-step work or edited files.

maintainers use process labels to identify the concrete next step:

- `needs-reproduction`: provide a reproducible case and exact steps.
- `needs-tests`: add the missing regression or coverage tests.
- `needs-evidence`: provide the required recording, logs, results, or benchmark.
- `needs-human-explanation`: explain the rationale or material changes yourself.
- `needs-scope-approval`: get maintainer agreement before continuing the work.

you are welcome to reopen the contribution, or submit a corrected replacement
that links the original, after addressing that request.

reopening or resubmitting without addressing the stated request results in a
seven-calendar-day contribution cooldown, beginning when a maintainer posts the
cooldown notice. during the cooldown, you may not open or reopen issues or pull
requests, or submit review comments in this repository. the next submission
after that cooldown that again reopens or resubmits without addressing a
concrete remediation request results in a repository contribution
ban.

enforcement is based on accountable ownership, accepted scope, evidence, and
the contributor's ability to explain the work.

### reporting bugs

this section guides you through submitting a bug report for screen pipe. following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.

### suggesting enhancements

this section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for screen pipe, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

- use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- explain why this enhancement would be useful to most screen pipe users.

### pull requests

- fill in the required template
- do not include issue numbers in the pr title
- include screenshots and animated gifs in your pull request whenever possible — but **never commit media files** to the repo (no screenshots, mockups, or recordings under `docs/`, `.github/`, or the repo root; they bloat git history and are never referenced by the code). host them on github and paste the url into the pr body:
  - **drag-drop (anyone, browser only):** drop the file into the pr description — github hosts it as a `https://github.com/user-attachments/...` link. needs no repo access, so this is the path for fork-based contributors.
  - **cli / agents (can't drag-drop):** attach the file as a release asset and link the url — images render inline whatever repo hosts them. maintainers with write access here: `gh release upload <tag> shot.png` (use a throwaway/`assets` release). from a fork: `gh release create media shot.png --repo <you>/screenpipe`, then link `https://github.com/<you>/screenpipe/releases/download/media/shot.png`. any external image host works too.
- follow the rust styleguides.
- end all files with a newline.

## styleguides

### git commit messages

- use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- we use git commit history to generate changelog with AI, so make sure to write relevant commit messages

### rust styleguide

all rust code must adhere to [rust style guide](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/4f2f477fded0a47b21ed3f6aeddeafa5db8bf518/src/doc/style-guide/src).

we follow [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html) folder structure.

## additional notes

### principles 

- **user fanatic: focus on building what people want and bring maximum value.**
- concurrency: channels > mutexes/locks
- simplicity: avoid premature optimization. write code that is easy for humans to read, fast for machines to execute. less is more. optimise for less code, less files, less dependencies, less complexity.
- production: we're building real products
- focus: avoid feature creep. focus on the core functionality and build upon it. focus on the user and their needs.
- use numbers: if you can't measure it, you can't improve it.
- positive-sum

### issue and pull request labels

this section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

* `bug` - issues that are bugs.
* `enhancement` - issues that are feature requests.
* `documentation` - issues or pull requests related to documentation.
* `good first issue` - good for newcomers.

## running tests

before submitting a pull request, run all the tests to ensure nothing has broken:

```bash
cargo test
```

on macOS, three clipboard round-trip tests mutate the system clipboard and are
ignored by the default suite. run them from an interactive GUI session and
serially so the tests do not race over the system clipboard:

```bash
cargo test -p screenpipe-a11y platform::macos::tests::test_get_clipboard_ -- --ignored --test-threads=1
```

## other hacks

### fast desktop UI loop without rebuilding rust

for React/layout work, run the desktop frontend directly in a browser:

```bash
cd apps/screenpipe-app-tauri
bun run dev:web
```

open <http://127.0.0.1:1420/home>. this uses in-memory Tauri and local-engine
mocks. use `bun run dev:web:live` to keep the mocked Tauri shell but talk to an
already-running local engine, or `bun run dev:tauri` for the full native app.
the supported fixtures, API-key setup, and native-validation boundary are in
[`apps/screenpipe-app-tauri/README.md`](apps/screenpipe-app-tauri/README.md#fast-browser-ui-development).

### running dev + prod in the same time

one command i keep using to avoid having to kill my main "production" process is:

```bash
./target/release/screenpipe record --port 3035 --data-dir "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/sp"
```

it will avoid conflicts with the port and avoid conflicts with the data dir

especially useful if you've done new database migrations and want to avoid breaking your previous months of data :)

on macos, prefer `$TMPDIR` (a per-user temp dir) over `/tmp` — the system periodically sweeps `/tmp` and can wipe your dev data-dir mid-session, while `$TMPDIR` sticks around for the session. the `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` form above uses it when set and falls back to `/tmp` otherwise.

if you keep prod running 24/7 and want this loop scripted — pull, run dev, put prod back when you're done — [`scripts/dev`](scripts/dev) does it both ways: the cli on its own isolated dir+port (same idea as above) or the app via `bun run dev:tauri`. it also documents the apple-silicon build gotchas (full xcode, metal toolchain, `pre_build.js`). optional; macos only.

### macos: keeping screen/mic/accessibility permissions across dev rebuilds

normal development does not package or sign an app. use `bun run dev:tauri` or
`bun run build:tauri:dev`; do not add signing flags to either command. only use
`apps/screenpipe-app-tauri/scripts/build_macos.sh` when a test specifically needs
a stable signed `.app` identity for tcc permissions. the canonical commands and
the reason for this separation are in
[`docs/macos-dev-builds.md`](docs/macos-dev-builds.md).

### debugging github action

ssh into the runner:

```yaml
- name: Setup tmate session # HACK
  if: matrix.platform == 'windows-latest'
  uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
```

run locally: https://github.com/nektos/act

### debugging memory errors

using tokio-console:

```bash
# terminal 1
RUST_LOG="tokio=debug,runtime=debug" RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo run --bin screenpipe --features debug-console
# terminal 2
cargo install tokio-console
tokio-console
```

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=address" cargo run --bin screenpipe
# or
RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=leak" cargo run --bin screenpipe
```

for leak tracking, you can use the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-instruments
# tracking leaks over 60 minutes time limit
cargo instruments -t Leaks --bin screenpipe --features metal --time-limit 600000 --open
```

then open the file in `target/release/instruments` using xcode -> open developer tool -> instruments.

### profiling cpu

to investigate "where is screenpipe burning cpu", capture a sampling profile + a cpu/mem time series against the running process. recipes below produce comparable output on macos and windows.

**macos** (built-in, no install):

```bash
PID=$(pgrep -x screenpipe-app || pgrep -x screenpipe | head -1)

# 1) cpu/mem time series — 10s interval for 10min
( echo "ts,pcpu,pmem,rss_mb"
  for i in $(seq 1 60); do
    read pcpu pmem rss < <(ps -p $PID -o pcpu=,pmem=,rss=)
    echo "$(date +%H:%M:%S),$pcpu,$pmem,$((rss/1024))"
    sleep 10
  done ) > /tmp/sp-cpu.csv

# 2) sampling profile — 10min @ 1ms (call-tree, symbolicated)
sample $PID 600 -file /tmp/sp-sample.txt
```

aggregate hot leaf functions:

```bash
awk '/Call graph/,/Binary Images/' /tmp/sp-sample.txt \
  | grep '(in ' | sed -E 's/^[[:space:]+!|:]*//; s/  \(in .*$//' \
  | grep -E "^[0-9]+ (screenpipe|AXUIElement|cidre|onnxruntime|sqlite)" \
  | awk '{n=$1+0; $1=""; sub(/^ +/,"",$0); if(n>mx[$0])mx[$0]=n}
         END{for(k in mx) printf "%8d  %s\n", mx[k], k}' \
  | sort -rn | head -30
```

**windows** (samply, install once: `cargo install samply`):

```powershell
$sp = (Get-Process screenpipe-app,screenpipe -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
       Sort-Object WorkingSet64 -Descending | Select-Object -First 1).Id

# 1) cpu/mem time series — 10s interval for 10min
"ts,pcpu,ws_mb,priv_mb" | Out-File $env:TEMP\sp-cpu.csv
1..60 | ForEach-Object {
  $p1=Get-Process -Id $sp; $c1=$p1.TotalProcessorTime.TotalSeconds
  Start-Sleep 1
  $p2=Get-Process -Id $sp; $c2=$p2.TotalProcessorTime.TotalSeconds
  $pcpu=[math]::Round(($c2-$c1)*100,1)
  "$(Get-Date -Format HH:mm:ss),$pcpu,$([math]::Round($p2.WorkingSet64/1MB)),$([math]::Round($p2.PrivateMemorySize64/1MB))" |
    Add-Content $env:TEMP\sp-cpu.csv
  Start-Sleep 9
}

# 2) sampling profile — 10min, view at https://profiler.firefox.com
samply record --save-only -o $env:TEMP\sp.json.gz --duration 600 --pid $sp
```

fallback if samply unavailable: `wpr -start CPU -filemode; Start-Sleep 600; wpr -stop /tmp/sp.etl` and open the etl in [wpa](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer) or perfview.

share both files (`sp-cpu.csv` + `sp-sample.txt` / `sp.json.gz`) in the issue when reporting cpu regressions.

### benchmarks

```
cargo bench
```

[check benchmark visuals](https://screenpipe.github.io/screenpipe/dev/bench/)

### creating new migrations

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli
sqlx migrate add <migration_name>
```

### fixing database migration issues

if you encounter errors with missing migrations (e.g., `migration XXXXXXXXXX was previously applied but is missing`), you can fix it by removing the problematic migration from the SQLite database:

```bash
# remove specific migration
sqlite3 ~/.screenpipe/db.sqlite "DELETE FROM _sqlx_migrations WHERE version = XXXXXXXXXX;"

# verify migrations
sqlite3 ~/.screenpipe/db.sqlite "SELECT * FROM _sqlx_migrations;"

# if issues persist, you can take the nuclear approach:
# 1. backup your database
cp ~/.screenpipe/db.sqlite ~/.screenpipe/db.sqlite.backup

# 2. reset migrations table
sqlite3 ~/.screenpipe/db.sqlite "DROP TABLE _sqlx_migrations;"
```

### set up azure ubuntu vm with display & audio

```bash
# Set variables
RG_NAME="my-avd-rgg"
LOCATION="westus2" 
VM_NAME="ubuntu-avd"
IMAGE="Canonical:0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy:22_04-lts-gen2:latest"
VM_SIZE="Standard_D2s_v3"  

# Create resource group
az group create --name $RG_NAME --location $LOCATION

# Create VM
az vm create \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --name $VM_NAME \
  --image $IMAGE \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --size $VM_SIZE

# Enable RDP
az vm open-port --port 3389 --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $VM_NAME

# Install xrdp, audio, and desktop environment
az vm run-command invoke \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --name $VM_NAME \
  --command-id RunShellScript \
  --scripts "
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y xrdp ubuntu-desktop pulseaudio
    sudo systemctl enable xrdp
    sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert
    echo 'startxfce4' | sudo tee /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
    sudo systemctl restart xrdp
    sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp
  "

# Enable audio redirection
az vm run-command invoke \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --name $VM_NAME \
  --command-id RunShellScript \
  --scripts "
    echo 'load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-anonymous=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/pulse/default.pa
    sudo systemctl restart pulseaudio
  "

# Get IP address
IP=$(az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $VM_NAME --output table | grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" | head -1)

# Now you can open Microsoft Remote Desktop and use the IP in new PC to connect to it

# RDP into the VM
ssh azureuser@$IP

# Forwarding port to local 
ssh -L 13389:localhost:3389 azureuser@$IP

# Changing password
az vm user update \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --name $VM_NAME \
  --username azureuser \
  --password <new-password>
```

now you can either dev screenpipe on linux or run screenpipe in the cloud that record your local macos. make sure to configure microsoft remote desktop to forward audio

## generating openapi.yaml

run screenpipe first and then go to http://localhost:3030/openapi.yaml

```bash
open http://localhost:3030/openapi.yaml
```

we use this for our docs through mintlify, usually the output is broken and i use cursor agent to fix it using ths prompt:

```
please run this command:
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file docs/mintlify/openapi.yaml -o /tmp
and fix the openapi.yaml file and rerun the command until it works
```

i also run this prompt in agent mode ...

```
how can i improve this openapi?
mainly want to showcase most useful endpoint in priority and stuff like getting context ...
get rid of semantic search bcs not prod rdy also
 @index.ts 
```

make sure to run 

`npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file docs/mintlify/openapi.yaml -o /tmp`

to validate the openapi.yaml file is valid btw before pushing

### testing paid-plan code paths locally

if you want to exercise paid-plan features (search filters, cloud sync, etc.) without a subscription, you can use the following environment variables during local development:

| to test... | set this environment variable |
| :--- | :--- |
| **all paid features unlocked** (treats user as entitled) | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SCREENPIPE_DEV_BILLING_BYPASS=true` |
| **the paywall/lock screen** (forces entitlement check) | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SCREENPIPE_FORCE_BILLING_GATE=true` |
| **e2e test bypass** | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SCREENPIPE_E2E=true` |
| **dev-build bypass** | `TAURI_ENV_DEBUG=true` |
| **skip interactive onboarding** | `SCREENPIPE_SKIP_ONBOARDING=1` (or `true` / `yes`) |
| **seed e2e tests (e.g. onboarding)** | `SCREENPIPE_E2E_SEED=onboarding` |

You can also force the billing gate in a bypassed dev environment by setting the `screenpipe_e2e_force_billing_gate` key in `localStorage` to `"1"`.
