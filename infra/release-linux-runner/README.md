# Persistent Azure Linux release runner

This stack provisions one always-on Ubuntu 24.04 Azure VM for Linux jobs in
`Release App` and `Release Enterprise`. The default `Standard_D16as_v7` has 16
vCPUs and 64 GiB RAM. A retained 1 TiB Premium SSD stores Cargo, Rust, Bun,
native dependency, compiler, and Tauri caches.

The VM has explicit NAT egress and no public IP or inbound rule. It uses Trusted
Launch, automatic platform patching, a systemd-managed GitHub runner, Azure
Monitor, availability alerting, and deletion locks on the VM and cache disk.
The job-start hook accepts only `workflow_dispatch` runs of the two release
workflows from `main`; job secrets remain in GitHub and publication remains a
separate human-only action. `force_github_runners=true` is the escape hatch.

```bash
./infra/release-linux-runner/deploy.sh
./infra/release-linux-runner/register.sh
./infra/release-linux-runner/status.sh
```

For a pre-merge dry run, temporarily add the exact branch workflow ref while
registering, then immediately register again without it after the test:

```bash
EXTRA_ALLOWED_WORKFLOW_REF='screenpipe/screenpipe/.github/workflows/release-app.yml@refs/heads/codex/azure-linux-release-runner' \
  ./infra/release-linux-runner/register.sh
```
