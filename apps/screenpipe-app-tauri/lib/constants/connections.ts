// "Notification"/"Productivity" buckets) so every tool lands in a precise,
// intuitive group.
//
// Keys MUST match the tile id: for backend integrations that is the
// `IntegrationDef.id` (see crates/screenpipe-connect/src/connections/*.rs,
// e.g. github -> "github", google docs -> "google-docs"); for frontend-only
// tiles it is the hardcoded id in connections-section.tsx.
//
// When you add a connection, add it here too — anything missing falls back to
// the coarse backend bucket and looks misplaced. Category labels here are the
// display labels; keep them in sync with CATEGORY_ORDER in connections-section.tsx.
