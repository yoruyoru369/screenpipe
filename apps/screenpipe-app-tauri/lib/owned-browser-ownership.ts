/**
 * Ownership logic for the embedded owned-browser sidebar.
 *
 * The owned browser is a singleton webview shared by every chat and every
 * background pipe, and its Tauri events are broadcast to all windows. Each
 * navigation is tagged with an `owner` (the chat/session that issued it, or
 * `pipe:<name>` for a background pipe). The sidebar uses these helpers to drop
 * navigations that belong to a chat other than the one on screen, so a
 * background pipe's page never pops into an unrelated chat.
 *
 * Kept here (no React / Tauri imports) so the rules are unit-testable in
 * isolation — see `lib/__tests__/owned-browser-ownership.test.ts`.

 *
 * - owner === conversationId → this chat's own browser lifecycle event,
 *   honored.
 * - owner === agentSessionId → this chat's own running agent. The navigation
 *   `owner` is the session id the agent process was spawned under (the value
 *   the bash shim forwards as `x-screenpipe-session`). That is normally equal
 *   to `conversationId`, but the React `conversationId` state can lag the ref
 *   the agent was started with, or a spawn can fall back to a non-matching
 *   session id — in either case the agent's own page would otherwise never
 *   reveal. Honor it when the owner matches the id the on-screen chat's agent
 *   actually runs under. Still safe: another chat's agent / a background pipe
 *   runs under a different session id, so its navigations are still dropped.
 * - owner null/empty → foreign/stale, ignored. All supported restore/reload
 *   paths now send the real `conversationId`; leaving ownerless events
 *   writable lets the singleton browser leak into whichever chat is open.
 * - otherwise (a different owner, INCLUDING when no chat is bound) → foreign,
 *   ignored. A null/empty conversationId means a fresh chat: any tagged event
 *   necessarily belongs to another chat or a background pipe.
