//! Launch-time self-heal for transient SQLite hard faults.
//!
//! A `SQLITE_IOERR_SHORT_READ` (extended code 522) under heavy concurrent load
//! desyncs the WAL index against the WAL it describes. Every pool is torn down
//! and the database is durably quarantined, which is correct while the faulted
//! process is still running: its live view of `-shm` cannot be trusted. (That
//! index is file-backed even under `unix-excl` — see the VFS note in
//! `screenpipe-db`'s `db/setup.rs`.)
//!
//! The quarantine is *cross-launch*, though, and that part over-fires. Once
//! every handle is gone the index no longer outlives the fault: the first
//! connection in a fresh process rebuilds it from the WAL, so the desync is
//! gone before the first read. Three separate incidents (2026-07-02,
//! 2026-08-05, 2026-08-11) all ended the same way: `PRAGMA quick_check`
//! returned `ok` on the quarantined file, and the "recovery" rebuilt a
//! database that was never damaged. In the meantime
//! recording stayed off — hours, in the 2026-08-11 case, because nothing resumes
//! until a human notices the tray and runs a repair.
//!
//! So: verify instead of assume, but only for the exact failure supported by
//! that evidence. If the marker records `SQLITE_IOERR_SHORT_READ` (522) and the
//! installed generation passes a read-only health check, resolve the quarantine
//! and start recording. Missing/generic result codes, other IOERR variants,
//! corruption (`SQLITE_CORRUPT`, `SQLITE_NOTADB`), and a full disk
//! (`SQLITE_FULL`) keep the existing fail-closed path and require a verified
//! replacement generation.
