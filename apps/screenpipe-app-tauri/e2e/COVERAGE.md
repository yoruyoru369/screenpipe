# E2E Coverage Map

This is a behavioral coverage dashboard for the Tauri/WebDriver E2E suite.
It is not line or branch coverage. A spec contributes coverage to each platform
and layer declared in the manifest, weighted by confidence and criticality.

- Manifest: `e2e/coverage-map.json`
- Specs directory: `e2e/specs`
- Mapped specs: 67
- Declared test blocks: 210
- Weighted coverage points: 160.7

Confidence weights: strong=1.0, partial=0.7, conditional=0.4, smoke=0.3.
Criticality weights: high=1.0, medium=0.7, low=0.4.
Declared test blocks are counted statically from source, so parameterized specs
can execute more runtime cases than this number shows.

## Platform Summary

| Platform | Specs | Declared tests | Weighted points | Layers | Features | Critical score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| windows | 57 | 196 | 155.3 | 15 | 61 | 92% |
| macos | 64 | 175 | 132.9 | 17 | 63 | 89% |
| linux | 49 | 159 | 126.9 | 13 | 58 | 86% |

## Runtime Results

No runtime result directory was supplied. Run with
`--results-dir e2e/results` after WDIO emits runtime JSON to include actual
pass/fail/skip counts.

## Critical Gaps

- windows: Real capture, OCR, and indexing (weak); Updater install and rollback safety (gap).
- macos: Real capture, OCR, and indexing (weak); Audio device health (weak); Updater install and rollback safety (gap).
- linux: Real capture, OCR, and indexing (weak); Audio device health (gap); Updater install and rollback safety (gap).

## Execution Integrity

- Specs that claim coverage but contain zero executable test blocks: zzz-browser-state-chat-switch.spec.ts, zz-owned-browser-background-nav.spec.ts, zzz-owned-browser-headless.spec.ts. They assert nothing and no longer count toward any critical feature.
- Declared coverage below is NOT reconciled against execution: no runtime results
  were supplied. Specs can self-skip on hosted runners (no display, vision off,
  recording disabled) and still read as covered. Run `e2e:coverage:runtime` (or pass
  `--results-dir`) in CI to flag declared coverage that did not actually run.

| capture-frequency-floor.spec.ts | macos | capture-ocr, settings, real-ui-e2e | capture-ocr, settings-recording, restart-flow | high | conditional | real-user-flow | 1 | macOS fixed screenshot cadence regression: persists the 1s setting before immediate Apply & Restart, then verifies real capture attempts and frame writes. |
| chat-ask-user-tool-card.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-tools, pi-ask-user | medium | partial | mixed | 1 | Synthetic assistant tool block renders the Pi ask_user dropdown and sends the selected answer through the normal chat reply path. |

| chat-connections-context-duplicate.spec.ts | windows, macos | chat-ai | chat, chat-sidebar-dedupe | medium | partial | synthetic | 1 | QUARANTINED (#4689): connections-context wrapper stripping regression.

| chat-prefill-duplicate.spec.ts | macos | chat-ai | chat, chat-prefill | medium | partial | synthetic | 1 | QUARANTINED (#4610): cross-window prefill duplicate regression. The autoSend persist precondition is racy in CI — times out with 0 conversations (not the duplicate=2 it guards) ~100% Linux + ~33% macOS. Re-enable once it seeds the persisted conversation deterministically. |
| chat-settings-background-stream.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, settings, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-streaming, settings | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Opening the standalone Settings route mid-stream must not abort the chat: a long synthetic stream keeps running while the user round-trips to Settings, remains live in Recents, and restores the full response (early + final tokens) after the row is clicked. |
| chat-sidebar-groups.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-sidebar-groups | medium | strong | real-user-flow | 9 | Pipe auto-grouping (collapse, badge, expand/collapse, localStorage persistence) and manual sidebar groups (move-to-group, section headers, remove-from-group cleanup). 8 tests. |

| chat-switch-context-loss.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai | chat, chat-context | medium | partial | synthetic | 1 | Switching conversations during streaming must not corrupt state. |

| html-artifact-render.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e | brain, artifacts, html-sandbox | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Registers an HTML artifact, opens it in Brain, and asserts it renders inside a sandboxed allow-scripts iframe (CSP default-src 'none') whose global <style> never leaks into the host app DOM (regression: rehype-raw repainting the whole window). |
| macos-ui-performance.spec.ts | macos | performance, real-ui-e2e | timeline, audio-device-health | medium | conditional | performance | 2 | macOS-only timeline/audio UI performance guards. |

| search-request-priority.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, local-api | home-search, local-api-search | medium | partial | synthetic | 1 | Verifies keyword search request fires before secondary search, facet, and speaker requests. |

| timeline.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, capture-ocr | timeline, capture-ocr | high | conditional | real-user-flow | 3 | Timeline shell always runs; seeded frame assertion skips under no-recording. |

| updater-banner.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e | update-surfacing | high | partial | synthetic | 1 | Synthetic update-available event surfaces the restart-to-update banner (no relaunch). Real check/download/install + rollback stay manual via e2e/mock-updates; the debug e2e build disables the updater check under cfg!(debug_assertions). |

| zz-account-stale-subscription.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, settings, billing | account-card, billing-gate | medium | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Account 'active' plan card is gated on the session token (token AND cloud_subscribed) like the header, so a tokenless-but-subscribed stale shell (post-#3943 secret-store token desync) renders 'not logged in' with the active card gone. Mocks /api/user across all windows and clears set_cloud_token to reproduce the desync deterministically. |
| zz-app-entitlement-gate.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | settings, billing, real-ui-e2e | app-entitlement-gate, billing-gate | high | strong | real-user-flow | 2 | Production billing gate blocks an unentitled session behind the paywall and restores access when the forced-gate flag is cleared. |

| zz-enterprise-license-prompt.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | settings, billing, real-ui-e2e | app-entitlement-gate, billing-gate | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Enterprise license prompt handles invalid keys, full-seat errors, and retry success after seats are added without staying stuck in validating state. |
| zz-logout-resurrect.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, settings | account-logout, auth-session | high | strong | synthetic | 1 | Logout must not be resurrected by an in-flight loadUser. Logs in via a synthetic deep-link (?api_key=) with a mocked /api/user fetch, makes the fetch slow, fires it, then clicks logout while it is pending and asserts the slow response cannot re-write the user (the 'logout needs two clicks' bug). Covers the auth-generation guard in use-settings.tsx. |
| zz-owned-browser-background-nav.spec.ts | windows, macos | os-integration, window-lifecycle | owned-browser, window-lifecycle | low | smoke | command | 0 | Owned browser background navigation visibility. |
| zzz-browser-state-chat-switch.spec.ts | windows, macos | real-ui-e2e, storage-privacy | chat, owned-browser | high | strong | synthetic | 0 | Synthetic E2E (zzz- prefix, search-driven): starts from a fresh chat with no conversation file, seeds browser state before the first durable save, then verifies auto-save persists that state and it survives a switch away and back. Keeps native visibility assertions out of this spec because post-zz window state is too brittle; deeper save/merge coverage lives in focused tests. |
| zzz-owned-browser-headless.spec.ts | windows, macos | os-integration, window-lifecycle, local-api | owned-browser, window-lifecycle | high | strong | mixed | 0 | Headless owned browser for background pipes (#4248): with the sidebar never opened, a background eval and navigate-and-scrape over the local API lazily create a hidden offscreen child webview, return a real JS result (6*7 -> 42; document.readyState), and stay invisible; is_ready reflects real serviceability; the same singleton is then adopted into the sidebar panel (page state survives, no second webview). Search-driven and runs last because attaching the child to home tears down home's WebDriver handle. |
