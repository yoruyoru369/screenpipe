// First-launch onboarding redirect — the single most user-impactful e2e
// gap. Every other spec runs with `SCREENPIPE_E2E_SEED=onboarding,...`,
// which seeds the store as if onboarding were already complete and sends
// the app straight to /home. That coverage is great for *post*-onboarding
// behaviour but means a regression in the "fresh install → onboarding
// gate fires → user can see the welcome screen" path would ship invisible
// to CI.
//
// Run via `bun run test:e2e:onboarding-redirect` — the npm script sets
// `SCREENPIPE_E2E_SEED=no-recording` so the server still starts (without
// `no-recording`, the unsigned debug build early-returns at the permission
// gate and `/health` never responds) but the onboarding-completion seed
// is omitted, so the store reflects a fresh install.
//
// What we assert:
// 1. On boot, the URL is `/onboarding` — the gate fires.
// 2. The login slide actually rendered (text contains "screenpipe" + the
//    tagline) — defensive against the page mounting but a child component
//    throwing silently.
// 3. The home window handle is NOT what we land on first — catches a
//    regression where the gate redirects but then the home window opens
//    too, leaving the user with two windows and no clear next step.
