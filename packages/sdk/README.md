# @screenpipe/sdk

Commercial screen recording SDK for Electron, Swift, Tauri, and Node apps.

The SDK exposes the capture primitives from the native
[screenpipe](https://screenpi.pe) stack: record an MP4, grab JPEG preview
snapshots, read a mic level for preflight UI, and inspect the focused app.

## Install

```bash
npm install @screenpipe/sdk
# or
bun add @screenpipe/sdk
```

This package is source-available under the Screenpipe Commercial License, the
same license as the root repository. See [LICENSE.md](../LICENSE.md) at the repository root (bundled into the npm package at publish time).

## Node Quick Start

```ts
import { Recorder, requestPermissions } from "@screenpipe/sdk";

const permissions = await requestPermissions();
if (!permissions.screen) {
  throw new Error("Screen Recording permission is required");
}

const recorder = new Recorder({
  output: "/tmp/session.mp4",
  // Optional privacy filters — recording pauses (hard cut in the MP4)
  // while a matching window/URL is focused.
  // Plain strings match anywhere; `App::Title` scopes to one window of one app.
  ignoredWindows: ["1password", "private", "Slack::#hr"],
  ignoredUrls: ["wellsfargo.com", "chase"],
});
await recorder.start();

// ... user does stuff ...

await recorder.stop();
```

## Core API

### `new Recorder(options)`

- `options.output` (string, required): path where the MP4 is written.
- `options.monitorId` (number, optional): display id; defaults to the primary display.
- `options.microphone` (boolean, optional): accepted for forward compatibility.
- `options.systemAudio` (boolean, optional): accepted for forward compatibility.
- `options.ignoredWindows` (string[], optional): substring patterns matched
  case-insensitively against the focused app name and window title. While a
  matching window is in focus, the recorder skips writing frames — the MP4
  contains a hard cut over the filtered period. Mirrors the engine's
  `--ignored-windows` CLI flag.

  Each pattern may use an optional `App::Title` scope: `"Slack::#hr"` skips
  only the #hr window inside Slack and leaves other Slack channels recording.
  `"::Confidential"` matches any app whose title contains "Confidential".
  Plain `"Slack"` keeps the legacy "app OR title contains" behavior.
- `options.includedWindows` (string[], optional): substring whitelist. If
  non-empty, frames are written ONLY while a matching window is focused.
  Scoped entries (`"Greenhouse::Candidates"`) create a per-app whitelist —
  other apps stay unaffected. Unscoped entries keep the legacy "must match
  app or title" global semantics. Mirrors `--included-windows`.
- `options.ignoredUrls` (string[], optional): URL patterns to skip
  (case-insensitive, domain-aware match — `chase` matches `chase.com` and
  `online.chase.com` but not `purchase.com`). When the focused browser is on
  a matching URL, the recorder skips writing frames. Mirrors `--ignored-urls`.

Filtering uses the macOS Accessibility API; without that permission the
filter fails open (records everything). Without any filter list set, the
recorder stays on the zero-overhead fast path — no a11y polling is done.

### Methods

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `start()` | Start screen capture and write frames into the MP4. |
| `stop()` | Stop capture, flush the MP4 trailer, and close the file. Safe to call more than once. |
| `snapshot()` | Capture the recorder's monitor as a JPEG preview. |
| `framesWritten()` | Return frames written since `start()`. |
| `audioLevel()` | Return a smoothed microphone RMS level in `[0, 1]` for preflight UI. |
| `focusedApp()` | Return best-effort focused-window metadata; requires Accessibility permission on macOS. |
| `filterStatus()` | Return `{ paused, reason }` for the window/URL filter. Poll, or subscribe via the session wrapper's `paused`/`resumed` events. |
| `setFilters(patch)` | Replace the active filter lists at runtime — `{ ignoredWindows?, includedWindows?, ignoredUrls? }`. Takes effect within ≤ 1 s. |
| `requestPermissions()` | Trigger or check supported OS permissions. |

### Filter events (session wrapper)

`createScreenpipeSession` emits `paused` and `resumed` events whenever the
filter verdict flips. Payload: `{ paused: boolean, reason: string | null }`
where `reason` is one of `"ignored_window"`, `"included_window_mismatch"`,
`"ignored_url"`, `"incognito"`, `"excluded_app"`.

```ts
session.on("paused", ({ reason }) => {
  showBanner(`recording paused — ${reason}`);
});
session.on("resumed", () => {
  hideBanner();
});

// Runtime toggle (e.g. user flips "Pause on banking" in your settings UI):
await session.setFilters({ ignoredUrls: ["chase", "wellsfargo.com"] });
```

Audio is not muxed into the MP4 in v0.1.0.

## Telemetry & user identification

The session wrapper reports a small, PII-scrubbed set of crash and usage
events to screenpipe so we can keep the SDK healthy in the wild. Pass a
`userId` and that identifier is attached to every event, so a specific end
user of your app shows up in screenpipe's Sentry (crashes) and PostHog
(usage) dashboards.

```ts
import { createScreenpipeSession } from "@screenpipe/sdk/session";

const session = createScreenpipeSession({
  userId: currentUser.id, // identifies this user in screenpipe's dashboards
  appName: "acme-recorder", // optional segmentation tag
});
```

- **What is sent.** Crashes/errors go to Sentry (with the error message).
  Usage goes to PostHog: `recording_started`, `recording_stopped`
  (frame/byte/duration counts only), `recording_paused`/`recording_resumed`
  (with the enum reason), `permissions_changed`, plus one
  `session_initialized` ping. Window titles, app names, URLs and output
  file paths are never sent to PostHog.
- **What is NOT sent.** No screen content, no audio, no clipboard, no
  `app_switched` stream, no `frames_progress` ticks.
- **Opt out.** Set `telemetry: false` in the options, or set the env var
  `SCREENPIPE_SDK_TELEMETRY=0` (also honors `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` and
  `SCREENPIPE_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=1`). When off, the SDK makes no network
  calls.

Without a `userId`, events fall back to a per-session anonymous id, so set
`userId` if you want stable identification across sessions.

### Per-surface usage

All four surfaces accept the same `userId` / `appName` / `telemetry` knobs.

**Electron** (via the session passed to `registerScreenpipeIpc`):

```ts
registerScreenpipeIpc({ ipcMain, app, sessionOptions: { userId: currentUser.id } });
```

**Swift** (forwarded to the bundled Node bridge as env vars):

```swift
let config = ScreenpipeClient.Configuration(
  sdkRoot: sdkRoot,
  userId: currentUser.id,        // identifies this user in screenpipe's dashboards
  appName: "acme-recorder",      // optional
  telemetryEnabled: true         // set false to disable
)
let client = try ScreenpipeClient(configuration: config)
```

**Tauri** — reporting happens natively in the Rust plugin (no webview
`fetch`, so no Content-Security-Policy to configure). The JS client forwards
the identity to the plugin via `screenpipe_identify` on creation:

```ts
const client = createScreenpipeTauriClient({ userId: currentUser.id });
```

You can also set it (or a Rust-side default) when registering the plugin:

```rust
tauri::Builder::default()
    .plugin(screenpipe_tauri::init(
        screenpipe_tauri::ScreenpipeConfig::default().user_id("user-123"),
    ))
```

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run build:debug
node --test --test-concurrency=1 "__test__/**/*.test.mjs"
swift test
```

```bash
npm --prefix examples/electron-app run smoke
npm --prefix examples/tauri-app run smoke
SCREENPIPE_SWIFT_EXAMPLE_SMOKE=1 swift run --package-path examples/swift-app ScreenpipeExample
```

Run the optional native Tauri example compile with:

```bash

```

Before publishing:

```bash
cargo test --lib
bun run build
bun run prepublishOnly
npm pack --dry-run

Publish generated platform packages first, then publish the root
`@screenpipe/sdk` package.
