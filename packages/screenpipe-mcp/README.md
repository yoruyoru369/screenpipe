MCP server for screenpipe - search your screen recordings, audio transcriptions, and control your computer with AI.

## Installation

### Option 1: The screenpipe desktop app (Recommended)

The most reliable setup is to install the [screenpipe desktop app](https://screenpi.pe)
and connect Claude Desktop from **Settings → Connections** (or during onboarding).
This writes a config that:

- uses the **bundled `bun`** shipped with the app (an absolute path — no Node/`npx`
  or `PATH` dependency, and ~3× faster cold start), and
- injects your **`SCREENPIPE_LOCAL_API_KEY`** into the server's `env`, so the MCP
  authenticates instantly instead of running slow key discovery at startup.

Both matter: a config without the key forces the server to discover it via
subprocess fallbacks, which on a cold package cache can stall Claude Desktop's MCP
startup and produce `Could not attach to MCP server screenpipe`.

### Option 2: Manual NPX (no desktop app)

If you're not using the desktop app, edit your Claude Desktop config:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SCREENPIPE_LOCAL_API_KEY": "sp-…"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Requires Node/`npx` on `PATH`. Pin `@latest` so the first install doesn't cache a
stale version forever. Get your key with `screenpipe auth token`. If you omit the
key, the server will try to discover it (bundled bun → npx → local DB) — this works
but is slower and can time out on first run.

### Option 3: HTTP Server (Remote / Network Access)

The MCP server can run over HTTP using the [Streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http), allowing remote MCP clients to connect over the network instead of stdio. This is ideal when your AI assistant (e.g., OpenClaw) runs on a different machine than screenpipe.

```bash
# loopback only (default)
npx -y screenpipe-mcp --http --port 3031

# expose to your LAN with bearer auth
npx -y screenpipe-mcp --http --listen-on-lan --api-key $(openssl rand -hex 16)

# or from source — must build first so dist/ exists
bun install && bun run build
bun run start:http -- --port 3031
```

> Tip: `npx screenpipe-mcp-http` (without `--http`) does **not** work —
> npm resolves by package name, and there is no `screenpipe-mcp-http`
> package. The HTTP server ships as a transport inside the
> `screenpipe-mcp` package; use `--http` as shown above, or invoke the
> bin directly with `npx -p screenpipe-mcp screenpipe-mcp-http`.

The server exposes:
- **MCP endpoint**: `http://localhost:3031/mcp` — Streamable HTTP transport (POST for requests, GET for SSE stream)
- **Health check**: `http://localhost:3031/health` — always unauthenticated, for monitors

**Options:**
| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--port` | Port for the MCP HTTP server | `3031` |
| `--screenpipe-port` | Port where screenpipe API is running | `3030` |
| `--listen-on-lan` | Bind `0.0.0.0` so other devices on the LAN can connect. Requires `--api-key`. | off (binds `127.0.0.1`) |
| `--api-key <secret>` | Bearer token required for non-loopback requests (`Authorization: Bearer <secret>`). Loopback always allowed. | none |

**Connecting a remote MCP client:**

Point any MCP client that supports HTTP transport at the `/mcp` endpoint:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "url": "http://<your-ip>:3031/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your-secret>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If your machines are on different networks, expose port 3031 via Tailscale, SSH tunnel, or similar — see the [OpenClaw integration guide](https://docs.screenpi.pe/openclaw) for detailed examples.

> **Note:** The HTTP server currently exposes `search_content` only. The stdio server has the full tool set (export-video, list-meetings, activity-summary, search-elements, frame-context). We're working on bringing HTTP to full parity.

### Option 4: From Source

Clone and build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/screenpipe/screenpipe
cd screenpipe/packages/screenpipe-mcp
bun install
bun run build
```

Then configure Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/screenpipe-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Restart Claude Desktop after making changes.

## Testing

Test with MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx screenpipe-mcp
```

## Transport Modes

| Mode | Command | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **stdio** (default) | `npx screenpipe-mcp` | Claude Desktop, local MCP clients |
| **HTTP** | `npx screenpipe-mcp --http` | Remote clients, network access, OpenClaw on VPS |

## Available Tools

### search-content
Search through recorded content with content type filtering:
- `all` — OCR + Audio + Accessibility (default)
- `ocr` — Screen text from screenshots
- `audio` — Audio transcriptions
- `input` — User actions (clicks, keystrokes, clipboard, app switches)
- `accessibility` — Accessibility tree text
- Time range, app/window, and speaker filtering
- Pagination support

### export-video
Export screen recordings as video files:
- Specify time range with start/end times
- Configurable FPS for output video

### activity-summary
Get a lightweight compressed activity overview for a time range:
- App usage with active minutes and frame counts
- Recent accessibility texts
- Audio speaker summary

### list-meetings
List detected meetings with id, duration, app, attendees, and note snippet. Pass `q` to filter by substring (title, attendees, notes) — `q` searches all meeting history, so omit the time range when looking for a person or topic. Follow up with `get-meeting` (optionally `include_transcript: true`) for the full note and speaker-attributed transcript.

### search-elements
Search structured UI elements (accessibility tree nodes and OCR text blocks):
- Filter by source, role, app, time range
- Much lighter than search-content for targeted UI lookups
- Returns a compact `outline` view by default — a deduped, indented tree of the
  text-bearing nodes (`#id` refs, `(off-screen)` flags), ~91% fewer tokens than
  raw element JSON

### get-frame-elements
The whole element tree for one frame, as the same compact outline.

### frame-context
Get accessibility text, parsed tree nodes, and extracted URLs for a specific frame.

### keyword-search
Fast FTS5 keyword search across OCR + audio combined. Returns matches with `frame_id`, app, timestamp, and text positions.

### list-meetings / get-meeting / update-meeting / start-meeting / stop-meeting
Manage the meeting store. `list-meetings` filters by substring; `get-meeting` returns title/attendees/times/full note (add `include_transcript: true` for the speaker-attributed transcript). `update-meeting` writes only the fields you pass. `start-meeting` and `stop-meeting` drive manual meeting recording sessions.

### search-speakers / list-unnamed-speakers / update-speaker / merge-speakers
Speaker identification workflow. Search by name prefix, list speakers that haven't been named yet, rename a speaker, or merge two speakers when the same person was detected as different ones.

### add-tags
Tag a screen frame (vision) or audio chunk (audio) so it can be retrieved later.

### update-memory
Create, update, or delete a persistent memory (facts, preferences, decisions the user wants to remember).

### send-notification
Send a notification to the screenpipe desktop UI.

### control-recording
Start or stop audio recording. This does not pause or resume screen capture.

### health-check
Check if screenpipe is running and healthy. Returns recording status, frame/audio stats, and timestamps.

### list-audio-devices
List available audio input/output devices for recording.

### list-monitors
List available monitors/screens for capture.

### list-pipes / create-pipe / run-pipe / pipe-logs
Manage pipes — scheduled AI automations that run a markdown prompt on a schedule (e.g. "every day at 9am"). `list-pipes` shows enabled state + schedule; `create-pipe` creates one; `run-pipe` triggers a one-off test run; `pipe-logs` fetches recent execution output.

### team-search / team-devices / team-records
Team-tier tools, registered only when an enterprise admin token is configured. `team-search` runs substring search across the entire org's telemetry, `team-devices` lists enrolled devices (hostname, OS), and `team-records` dumps chronological org data for a time window.

## Example Queries in Claude

- "Search for any mentions of 'rust' in my screen recordings"
- "Find audio transcriptions from the last hour"
- "Show me what was on my screen in VSCode yesterday"
- "Export a video of my screen from 2-3pm today"
- "Find what John said in our meeting about the database"
- "What did I type in Slack today?" (uses content_type=input)
- "What did I copy to clipboard recently?" (uses content_type=input)
- "Show me accessibility text from Chrome" (uses content_type=accessibility)

## Requirements

- screenpipe must be running on localhost:3030
- Node.js >= 18.0.0

## Notes

- All timestamps are handled in UTC
- Results are formatted for readability in Claude's interface
- macOS automation features require accessibility permissions
- The MCP tools already return compact, readable text (the element tools default to the `outline` view). If you instead call the underlying screenpipe REST API directly (e.g. via `curl`), the list endpoints (`/search`, `/elements`, `/frames/{id}/elements`) accept `?format=csv|tsv` for a columnar table (column names written once) and `?fields=a,b,c` to select only the columns you need (dotted paths like `content.text`); the element endpoints also accept `?format=outline` (the same tree the MCP tools return, ~91% fewer tokens than JSON). On list-shaped results that is a 70–91% token cut versus the default JSON, which stays unchanged when no param is set.

## Privacy Policy

The Screenpipe MCP server is a local-only bridge between Claude and your
local Screenpipe instance. It does not collect, transmit, or store tool
results, recordings, OCR text, audio transcripts, screenshots, or UI events
on its own.

### What this MCP server does
When Claude invokes a tool (`search-content`, `activity-summary`, etc.)
the MCP server forwards the request to `http://localhost:3030` — the
Screenpipe daemon running on your machine — and returns the response.
That's the entire data path.

### Data collection
The MCP server sends privacy-preserving crash and error reports to Screenpipe's
Sentry project so we can diagnose startup failures like "server disconnected"
or "could not attach to MCP server". These reports include the MCP package
version, runtime, transport mode, and sanitized exception details. They do not
include tool arguments, tool results, screen content, audio, transcripts,
screenshots, API tokens, or your home-directory path.

To disable crash/error reporting, set any of:
`SCREENPIPE_MCP_SENTRY_DISABLED=1`, `SCREENPIPE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`, or
`SCREENPIPE_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` in the MCP launch environment.

### Data usage
Tool calls are passed straight through to your local Screenpipe daemon
and the results stream back to Claude. The MCP server doesn't keep
anything.

### Data storage
Nothing is stored by the MCP server itself. Recordings, OCR text,
audio transcripts, and UI events are stored by the Screenpipe app in a
SQLite database under `~/.screenpipe/` on your device. Retention is
whatever you configure inside the Screenpipe app — typically you
control it via the storage settings panel.

### Third-party sharing
The MCP server talks to `localhost:3030` for tool calls and to Screenpipe's
Sentry project for sanitized crash/error reports unless disabled as above.
It does not contact Anthropic or send recorded content to Screenpipe's servers.
If you choose to enable optional cloud features inside the Screenpipe
app itself (e.g. cloud sync, cloud AI), those are governed by the
Screenpipe app's privacy policy, not this MCP server's data flow.

### Retention
The MCP server has no persistent state. The data your Screenpipe app
captures is retained according to your Screenpipe storage configuration
and is deletable at any time (`rm -rf ~/.screenpipe` removes everything).
