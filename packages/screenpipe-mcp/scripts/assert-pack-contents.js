/**
 * Assert that the npm tarball this tree would publish is actually a
 * gateway-capable build (SCR-352).
 *
 * The gate now covers two incidents. `screenpipe-mcp@0.18.15` omitted compiled
 * modules entirely. `screenpipe-mcp@0.19.1` shipped a large runtime dependency
 * tree that Bun/npx can corrupt when several agents cold-start concurrently;
 * production then fails on a random missing AJV, Zod, SDK, locale, or local
 * module. A later audit also found an MCP authentication fallback that opened
 * the recorder's live SQLite database outside Screenpipe's locking boundary.
 * The package must therefore ship self-contained entry bundles, no runtime
 * dependency installation surface, and no direct recording-database access.
 *
 * Two independent classes of failure are checked, because they fail
 * differently:
 *   - REQUIRED_PATHS — all three public entry bundles must be present.
 *   - REQUIRED_MARKERS / FORBIDDEN_MARKERS — the file is present but was built
 *     from the wrong tree (stale `dist/`, or a revert of the gateway support).
 *     Grepping the built bytes is the only check that can tell those apart.
 *   - runtimeDependencyFailures — package.json must not make bunx/npx install
 *     the dependency graph that produced the observed shared-cache races.
 *
 * Usage (both `test-mcp.yml` and `release-mcp.yml` call this — the release job
 * runs it immediately before `npm publish`, since that is the only place where
 * being wrong is unrecoverable):
 *
 *   npm run verify:pack
 *
 * `npm pack --dry-run` writes nothing and needs no registry auth.
