//! Raise the process file-descriptor soft limit. Single source of truth shared
//! by the standalone `screenpipe-engine` binary and the Tauri desktop app.
//!
//! Why this is centralized: the desktop app **embeds** this engine in-process,
//! so it never runs the binary's `main()` and historically kept macOS's default
//! soft `RLIMIT_NOFILE` of 256 — while opening a large SQLite pool (high-tier:
//! read 27 + write 8 + secret 2 = up to 37 connections, each holding 3 fds for
//! db/-wal/-shm) plus video/audio/sockets. Crossing 256 makes SQLite fail a
//! -wal/-shm/connection open mid-write with `SQLITE_IOERR` (code 522), which
//! desyncs the shared WAL-index into "database disk image is malformed"
//! (`SQLITE_CORRUPT`, code 11). Raising the soft limit removes that whole
//! corruption class. Both entry points MUST call this before any DB/socket work.
//!
//! Override the target with the `SCREENPIPE_FD_LIMIT` env var.

/// Raise the soft `RLIMIT_NOFILE` toward `SCREENPIPE_FD_LIMIT` (default 8192),
/// capped by the hard limit. No-op if the current soft limit already suffices.
