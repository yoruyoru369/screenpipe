// ── Silent-wedge watchdog (#3939) ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Symptom: VisionManager status stays `Running` and the tray shows "Recording",
// but the capture loop has stopped reaching terminal outcomes — for ~1h in the
// original report — with no auto-recovery. The existing recovery paths all miss
// it: the monitor watcher only restarts when status != Running, and the /health
// stall flag only colors the response, nothing acts on it.
//
// Detection: a healthy pipeline ticks the historical `last_db_write_ts` clock
// on every DB write, dedup-skip, and explicit corrupt-frame skip. So
// "capture attempts still fresh while `last_db_write_ts` has been frozen for a
// long time" cannot happen on a healthy idle screen — it only happens when
// captures are erroring/timing out (DB write pool saturated after a disk-I/O
// stall: "writes fail with PoolTimedOut forever until restart"). That makes it
// a low-false-positive trigger for a recovery restart.
//
// Scope: this covers the "still attempting" wedge only. The "gone silent" wedge
// (loop blocked inside a non-cancellable sync SQLite call) also stops ticking
// `last_capture_attempt_ts`, and a restart can't preempt sync FFI; that needs
// cancellable DB I/O and is tracked separately.

/// The capture loop must still be issuing attempts this recently for the wedge
/// to be the restartable "still-attempting" kind.
const WEDGE_ATTEMPT_FRESH_SECS: u64 = 60;
/// No terminal outcome for at least this long while
/// attempts stay fresh → wedged. Deliberately looser than the /health stall
/// threshold (60s) because the action here (a capture restart) is disruptive.
const WEDGE_DB_STALE_SECS: u64 = 120;
/// Ignore the warm-up window so a pipeline that hasn't written its first frame
/// yet is never mistaken for a stall.
const WEDGE_MIN_UPTIME_SECS: f64 = 120.0;

// ── Gone-silent / dead-loop watchdog ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The wedge watchdog above only fires while the loop is STILL ATTEMPTING
// (`last_capture_attempt_ts` fresh). It deliberately misses the case this
// report surfaced: status stays `Running` but the capture loop has stopped
// even attempting — the macOS ScreenCaptureKit stream froze and the loop is
// parked, or the loop/task exited without flipping status. `StreamLivenessWatch`
// (event_driven_capture) catches the frozen-but-latched stream by frame-seq, and
// `status != Running` catches a clean stop, but a status-stuck-Running dead loop
// falls through all of them — the app would show "recording" for hours with no
// frames (only an OS display reconfigure on lock/unlock unwedged it).
//
// The task-liveness signal is `last_capture_loop_heartbeat_ts`, not capture
// attempts. Focus-aware scheduling deliberately parks non-focused displays in
// Warm/Cold states without attempts, while a healthy loop still wakes on a
// bounded backstop and advances its heartbeat. A long-frozen loop heartbeat
// past warm-up is therefore broken capture; old attempts alone are not.

/// No terminal outcome for at least this long while the loop heartbeat is also
/// stale → gone-silent. Higher than `WEDGE_DB_STALE_SECS` because we cannot
/// lean on active capture work to confirm the rest of the pipeline is alive,
/// so we want extra confirmation before the disruptive restart.
const SILENT_DB_STALE_SECS: u64 = 240;
/// Same gone-silent fault, but confirmed while the user is demonstrably at the
/// machine — shortened so recovery beats the desktop's own incident alert
/// instead of trailing it.
///
/// The app raises "screen capture may be stalled" after `frame_status` goes
/// stale (60s) plus 90 attended one-second checks, i.e. 150s. Recovery at
/// `SILENT_DB_STALE_SECS` (240s) therefore always landed ~100s *after* the
/// alert: on every wedge the user was shown a scary pill offering a restart
/// that the watchdog was already going to perform, and the observed cost was
/// ~250s of lost screen history per event (six events, ~21 minutes, in one
/// day on one machine).
///
/// Effective recovery is `max(attempt_fresh_secs, this)`: `loop_stopped`
/// already requires `attempt_fresh_secs` (60s) of *complete* loop silence, so
/// this only has to clear that floor. 65s keeps a small confirmation margin on
/// the db-stale clock while landing far below the 150s alert — a loop that
/// normally beats 4/s and has emitted nothing for a minute while input flows is
/// not a parked display, it is lost recording.
///
/// The idle path keeps the conservative 240s window: an idle machine's wedge
/// self-heals and a restart there would be pure churn.
