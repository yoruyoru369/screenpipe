//! Screen capture and OCR. Accessibility trees are the primary text source
//! (`screenpipe-a11y`); OCR here is the fallback for pixels with no tree.
//!
//! - `monitor`, `capture_screenshot_by_window`, `wgc_capture` — grabbing pixels
//!   per platform. macOS goes through ScreenCaptureKit, Windows through WGC.
//! - `apple`, `microsoft`, `tesseract`, `custom_ocr` — the OCR backends. Pick
//!   via `utils::OcrEngine`; the native one is the default on each platform.
//! - `frame_comparison`, `ocr_cache`, `text_regions` — skipping work when the
//!   screen did not meaningfully change. This is what keeps idle cost near zero.
//! - `snapshot_writer` — writing frames out for the recorder.
//!
//! This is the hottest path in the product. It runs on every frame, forever, on
//! someone's laptop battery:
//!
//! - No per-frame heap allocation in the capture or compare loop, no blocking
//!   I/O, no unbounded channel. Reuse buffers.
//! - A capture backend can wedge without erroring. macOS ScreenCaptureKit has
//!   done exactly this in production: the call never returns and the thread
//!   looks alive. Bound every platform call and treat "no frame produced" as
//!   the failure signal, not "no error returned".
//! - Respect capture exclusions and privacy gates before pixels are read, not
//!   after. Filtering later means the frame already existed.
