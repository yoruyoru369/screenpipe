//! Meeting piggyback sweep ("smart recording" in the app): during a detected
//! meeting (flag on — ANY capture mode; the flag takes precedence over
//! `audio_capture_mode`, so a meeting engages it in continuous capture just as
//! in meetings-only), capture the meeting app's own audio via a per-process
//! tap and one authoritative mic it has open. While the meeting is active,
//! this is Screenpipe's single capture owner: its normal configured input and
//! output streams stay suspended even across pid gaps, tap startup/failure,
//! or an empty resolver. This does not request exclusive OS/device access.
//!
//! Two machines, one sweep:
//!
//! * **Far end** — pure decider (`decide_piggyback`) for the per-process
//!   Meeting Tap: suspend normal output immediately, then start/retry the tap
//!   with strikes + cooldown when it dies. Mirrors
//!   `decide_pinned_input_fallback` / `windows_output_follow`.
//!
//! * **Near end** — [`MicFollow`], an explicit per-meeting mic-follow state
//!   machine (`Adopted | Capturing → Backoff`). It exists because a previous
//!   per-tick reactive design starved the meeting app of its own microphone
//!   (observed live 2026-07-07, Meet/Zoom on AirPods): re-evaluating
//!   displacement every tick off `is_device_actively_streaming` turned every
//!   transient stream stall into a real close+open of a Bluetooth mic — an
//!   SCO renegotiation storm (#3750) that killed the app's capture.
//!
//!   The machine is **event-driven** (macOS): while piggybacking, the sweep
//!   registers CoreAudio property listeners (`piggyback_listeners`) on the
//!   system default-input selector and the tapped processes' input-device /
//!   is-running-input selectors. Any change wakes the device monitor
//!   immediately, so the sweep runs — and the machine follows — the instant
//!   CoreAudio publishes an in-app mic switch, not up to a poll interval
//!   later. The 2s tick remains purely as reconciliation (and is the only
//!   driver on Windows). Latency comes from events; SAFETY comes from these
//!   invariants, not from waiting:
//!
//!   - a resolved mic is followed on the FIRST sweep pass that observes it.
//!     There is no confirm delay: the wake fires only after the app's device
//!     acquisition is already visible in CoreAudio (and the poll path is a
//!     full cadence behind), so the machine can never race the app mid-SCO
//!     negotiation the way the old same-tick reactive open could;
//!   - a mic that is already running as an enabled device is **adopted** with
//!     zero device I/O, and the machine never opens, closes, or restarts it;
//!   - a WORKING stream is never closed or reopened — flapping liveness
//!     observations produce zero device actions;
//!   - an open failure or a dead capture stream retries FAST (the next event
//!     or tick, floored at [`MIC_RETRY_FLOOR_MS`]) through a single reopen
//!     point with at most one in-flight open per device — during a meeting
//!     the mic must come back ASAP. Only a PERSISTENTLY failing device
//!     ([`MIC_PERSISTENT_FAILURES`] consecutive failures spanning
//!     [`MIC_PERSISTENT_WINDOW_MS`]) slows to [`MIC_PERSISTENT_RETRY_MS`]
//!     retries (warned once), so a truly broken device can't hammer a
//!     Bluetooth link forever;
//!   - displacement of the user's other mics is a **meeting-duration latch**:
//!     normal streams are suspended immediately and resume only when the
//!     meeting ends. A resolver or provider gap can therefore never bring a
//!     second recorder back during a meeting.
