//! Minimal meeting detector — just an override flag for the audio pipeline.
//!
//! The actual meeting detection logic lives in `screenpipe-engine::meeting_watcher`.
//! This struct exists solely so the audio pipeline can query `is_in_meeting()` and
//! `is_in_audio_session()` without depending on the engine crate.
//!
//! The detection loop calls `set_v2_in_meeting(true/false)` and both
//! `is_in_meeting()` and `is_in_audio_session()` simply return that flag.
