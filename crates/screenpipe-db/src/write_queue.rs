//! Write coalescing queue for SQLite.
//!
//! Buffers individual write operations and executes them in batched transactions.
//! Instead of each write acquiring the write semaphore, getting a connection,
//! issuing BEGIN IMMEDIATE, and COMMITting separately, the drain loop:
//!
//! 1. Collects all pending writes (up to `MAX_BATCH_SIZE`)
//! 2. Acquires the write semaphore **once**
//! 3. Issues a single `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
//! 4. Executes all writes sequentially
//! 5. `COMMIT`s once
//! 6. Sends results back to each caller via oneshot channels
//!
//! This reduces per-write overhead from ~5ms (semaphore + BEGIN + COMMIT + fsync)
//! to ~5ms amortized over the entire batch.

// The old loop retried the SAME pool 3× then dropped the batch forever, silently
// losing writes until a manual restart (see reference_db_corruption_mmap). The
// drain loop now escalates on consecutive fatal batches:
//   * every `WRITE_POOL_REOPEN_EVERY` it reopens its own write pool in-process
//     (cheap; drops poisoned write connections);
//   * at `DEGRADED_AFTER` it flips `WriteQueueHealth::degraded` so the app can
//     surface "recording degraded";
//   * at `PERSISTENT_FAILURE_AFTER` it fires the `on_persistent_failure` hook
//     once — the seam the app uses to restart the engine, the only thing that
//     rebuilds the shared WAL-index + read pool (the real cure).

// legitimately hold the process-wide write coordinator for longer than a
// batch's semaphore budget, and `db/maintenance.rs` documents that as "the
// recording briefly pauses the UI warns about". So a contended batch must
// NOT restart the engine.
//
// But a *permanently* held permit — a leaked `OwnedSemaphorePermit` from a
// hung or aborted task — is indistinguishable from that, batch by batch, and
// had no escape at all: `BatchOutcome::Contention` set `degraded` and nothing
// else. Every batch then timed out forever with no reopen, no hook, no cure.
//
// These thresholds are deliberately far past any legitimate maintenance hold
// so the hook only fires on a genuine wedge.

/// Fire the persistent-failure hook after this many *consecutive* contended
/// batches. Each one costs a full `write_semaphore` timeout, so 60 is already
/// ~30 minutes of uninterrupted contention; this is the fast path for
/// write-heavy load, not the primary trigger.
const CONTENTION_PERSISTENT_AFTER: u64 = 60;

/// successful write in between.
///
/// Deliberately generous. `compact()` (full VACUUM) and `backup_to()`
/// (VACUUM INTO) hold the coordinator for as long as it takes to rewrite a
/// multi-GB capture database, and neither announces itself — they do not use
/// `request_write_pause`, so the drain loop cannot tell them apart from a
/// wedge. Restarting the engine mid-VACUUM would roll back the whole thing and
/// waste the work, so the budget has to sit clearly beyond any plausible
/// maintenance hold rather than merely beyond a typical one.
///
/// Thirty minutes without a single successful write is unambiguous: capture
/// writes arrive continuously while recording, so a run this long is either a
/// stuck coordinator or a maintenance operation that is itself a bug.
///
/// The better long-term fix is for the long maintenance paths to announce
/// their hold (the `WRITE_PAUSED` seam already exists for sleep), at which

//
//   * SCREENPIPE-CLI-SQ conflated "another writer holds the lock" (expected
//     during VACUUM, retry) with "the pool has no connections" (a real
//     starvation fault) and could not be triaged;
//   * no caller could branch on the cause, because the variant was gone.
//
// These messages are the stable contract. They are matched by the predicates
// below rather than re-derived at each call site, so a wording change cannot
// silently turn a retryable stall into a reported fault.
