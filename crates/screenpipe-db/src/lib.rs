//! SQLite storage for everything screenpipe captures: frames, OCR text,
//! accessibility trees, audio chunks, transcriptions, meetings, and their FTS
//! indexes.
//!
//! - `db` — the `DatabaseManager`, migrations, and query surface.
//! - `write_queue` — the single serialized writer. Every mutation goes here.
//! - `recovery` — page-level repair and fresh-generation swap after corruption.
//! - `cancellable_query` — search that can be aborted when a caller disconnects,
//!   so a slow query cannot pin a connection forever.
//! - `text_normalizer` / `text_similarity` — FTS5 query sanitizing and dedupe.
//!
//! Non-negotiables, all of them learned from real corruption incidents:
//!
//! - One writer per database path, process-wide. Writes serialize through
//!   [`screenpipe_sqlite_coordinator`]; never construct a second pool against a
//!   live database, and never hand a write pool to a background worker that did
//!   not join the coordinator.
//! - Faults are terminal for the generation. Once SQLite reports IOERR, CORRUPT,
//!   FULL, or NOTADB for a path, that path is tombstoned for the life of the
//!   process. An in-process restart must not reopen it. Recovery means a
//!   verified fresh file, not a retry.
//! - Never widen a write transaction to cover network or model work.
//!
//! Recovery procedure and incident history: `docs/SQLITE_RECOVERY.md`.
