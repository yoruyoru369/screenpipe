//! Error type shared across the sync crate.
//!
//! Categories are kept small on purpose — callers usually only care about
//! "is this transient (retry) or permanent (back off / surface)?" — and the
//! enum tags answer that without forcing the caller to string-match on a
//! single `Other(String)`.
