# screenpipe regression testing checklist

> **purpose**: prevent regressions. test core features rigorously every time

## critical edge cases (sorted by regression frequency)

### 1. window overlay & fullscreen spaces (macOS)

### 1.1. Live Text Interaction (macOS)

commits: `e9c76934`, `9acdf850`

- [ ] **Native Live Text selection** — On macOS, verify that native Live Text selection works within the app's text overlay.
- [ ] **Native Data Detectors** — On macOS, verify that native data detectors (e.g., phone numbers, addresses, dates) are active and clickable within the app's text overlay.
- [ ] **Cross-architecture Live Text compilation** — On both x86_64 (Intel) and arm64 (Apple Silicon) macOS machines, verify that Live Text functionality is available and works without compilation errors or runtime issues.


- [ ] **window mode CSS restore** — In window mode (not fullscreen), verify that CSS styling is correct and as expected (e.g., no unexpected transparent panels).
- [ ] **keyboard input in main window from tray** — Open the main window from the tray icon and immediately try typing. Verify that keyboard input works without requiring a click.
- [ ] **WKWebView keyboard focus recovery** — Interact with embedded web views (e.g., billing, help sections), then navigate back to other UI elements. Verify keyboard focus is correctly recovered by the WKWebView.



these break CONSTANTLY. any change to `window_api.rs`, `main.rs` shortcuts, activation policy, or NSPanel code must test ALL of these.

commits that broke this area: `0752ea59`, `d89c5f14`, `4a64fd1a`, `fa591d6e`, `8706ae73`, `6d44af13`, `b6ff1bf7`, `09a18070`

- [ ] **overlay shortcut on fullscreen space** — press shortcut while a fullscreen app (e.g., Chrome fullscreen) is active. overlay MUST appear on top.
- [ ] **chat shortcut on fullscreen space** — press chat shortcut while on a fullscreen space. chat panel MUST appear on top. Fixed: panel pre-created at startup, show uses order_front→activate order.
- [ ] **chat shortcut on normal desktop** — chat appears, receives keyboard focus, can type immediately.
- [ ] **overlay toggle on/off** — press shortcut twice. first shows, second hides. no "ghost" window left behind.
- [ ] **chat toggle on/off** — press chat shortcut twice. first shows, second closes.
- [ ] **overlay does NOT follow space swipe** — show overlay, then three-finger swipe to another space. overlay should NOT follow you (no blink-and-disappear). was broken by `MoveToActiveSpace` staying set.
- [ ] **no blink on show** — overlay appears instantly, no flash of white/transparent then reappear. was broken multiple times (`3097872b`, `8706ae73`, `09a18070`).
- [ ] **no blink on hide** — overlay disappears instantly. no momentary reappear after hiding.
- [ ] **overlay on second monitor** — with 2 monitors, show overlay. it appears on the monitor where the mouse cursor is.
- [ ] **window mode vs fullscreen mode** — switch overlay mode in settings. shortcut still works in both modes. no crash.
- [ ] **switch modes while overlay is visible** — change from fullscreen to window mode in settings while overlay is showing. should not crash (`b4eb2ab4`).
- [ ] **keyboard focus in overlay** — show overlay, start typing. text input works immediately without clicking (`d74d0665`, `5a50aaad`).
- [ ] **keyboard focus in chat** — show chat, start typing. text input works immediately.
- [ ] **escape closes overlay** — press Escape while overlay is visible. it hides.
- [ ] **no space jump on show** — showing the overlay should NOT cause a space transition animation (`6d44af13`, `d74d0665`).
- [ ] **no space jump on hide** — hiding the overlay should NOT switch you to a different space.
- [ ] **screen recording visibility setting** — toggle "show in screen recording" in settings. overlay should appear/disappear from screen recordings accordingly (`206107ba`).
- [ ] **search panel focus** — open search, keyboard focus is in search input immediately (`2315a39c`, `1f2681e3`).
- [ ] **ghost clicks after hide** — hide overlay via `order_out`. clicking where overlay was should NOT trigger overlay buttons (`32e1a962`).
- [ ] **pinch-to-zoom works** — pinch gesture on trackpad zooms timeline without needing to click first (`d99444a7`, `523a629e`).
- [ ] **shortcut reminder on all Spaces** — switch between 3+ Spaces (including fullscreen apps). reminder pill stays visible on every Space simultaneously.
- [ ] **shortcut reminder on fullscreen app** — fullscreen Chrome/Safari, reminder shows at top center. not just leftmost Space.
- [ ] **shortcut reminder doesn't steal focus** — showing reminder never takes keyboard focus from active app.
- [ ] **chat on non-primary Space** — switch to Space 3 (normal desktop), press chat shortcut. chat appears on Space 3, not Space 1. no Space transition animation.
- [ ] **chat re-show on fullscreen Space** — show chat on fullscreen Space, hide it, show again. must reappear on same fullscreen Space.
- [ ] **space monitor only hides main overlay** — swipe Spaces. main overlay hides. chat window and shortcut reminder are unaffected.
- [ ] **space monitor doesn't race with show** — show overlay via shortcut. the `activateIgnoringOtherApps` call must not trigger space monitor's hide callback.
- [ ] **Chat streaming UX** — Verify that chat streaming uses a state-aware grid dissolve loader for a smooth user experience.
- [ ] **chat always-on-top toggle** — Toggle the "chat always-on-top" setting and verify that the chat window behaves as expected (e.g., stays on top of other applications when enabled). (`b6c363e5`)
- [ ] **overlay hidden in OBS when screen recording toggle is off** — Verify that the overlay is NOT visible in OBS (or other screen capture tools) when the "show in screen recording" toggle is off. (`87d107a29`)
- [ ] **resizable shortcut overlay** — Change shortcut overlay size (small/medium/large) in settings and verify it updates correctly on all spaces. (`1e1e17171`)
- [ ] **overlay resize support for webview fallback** — Verify that the overlay can be resized even when using the webview fallback. (`d095f5994`)
- [ ] **text selection not blocked by URL overlays** — On URL-heavy pages, verify that text selection is not blocked by clickable URL overlays. (`eb9e65b4`)
- [ ] **macOS focused-app capture with AX observers** — On macOS, verify that focused-app capture works correctly when switching between applications, utilizing AX observers. (`22830119`)
- [ ] **macOS native Live Text interaction** — On macOS, verify that native Live Text interaction, including text selection and data detectors, is re-enabled and functions correctly. (`e9c76934`)
- [ ] **Livetext single worker thread** — verify no GCD thread exhaustion freeze during heavy livetext analysis. (`a3e29d42a`)
- [ ] **VisionKit semaphore timeouts** — verify no deadlocks in vision pipeline if VisionKit hangs (10s timeout). (`397f46133`)
- [ ] **Notification panel order_out** — verify no ghost clicks after hiding notification/shortcut panels. (`32fed7c8c`)
- [ ] **Excluded windows from screenshots** — Verify that windows specified in the ignore list are correctly excluded from full-monitor screenshots taken via ScreenCaptureKit (SCK). (`61212c429`)
- [ ] **Swift overlay meeting toggle** — Verify that the meeting toggle in the Swift-based overlay works correctly and reflects the recording state. (`e5e955aa6`)


### 2. dock icon & tray icon (macOS)

commits that broke this area: `0752ea59`, `7562ec62`, `2a2bd9b5`, `f2f7f770`, `5cb100ea`

- [ ] **dock icon visible on launch** — app icon appears in dock immediately on startup.
- [ ] **tray icon visible on launch** — tray icon appears in menu bar on startup.
- [ ] **dock icon persists after overlay show/hide** — show and hide overlay 5 times. dock icon must remain visible every time. was broken by Accessory mode switches.
- [ ] **tray icon persists after overlay show/hide** — same test. tray icon must remain visible.
- [ ] **dock right-click menu works** — right-click dock icon. "Show screenpipe", "Settings", "Check for updates" all work (`d794176a`).
- [ ] **tray menu items don't fire twice** — click any tray menu item. action happens once, not twice (`9e151265`).
- [ ] **tray health indicator** — tray icon shows green (healthy) or yellow/red (issues) based on recording status.
- [ ] **tray doesn't show false "Error" on transient issues** — Under load (running many pipes, high CPU), tray icon should not flip to "Error" if recording is actually working. Only sustained errors (>2min) show red. Tests under transient DB/OCR/audio pressure. (`abc234aae`)
- [ ] **tray on notched MacBook** — on 14"/16" MacBook Pro, tray icon is visible (not hidden behind notch). if hidden, user can Cmd+drag to reposition.
- [ ] **activation policy never changes** — after ANY user interaction, dock icon should remain visible. no Accessory mode switches. verify with: `ps aux | grep screenpipe`.
- [ ] **no autosave_name crash** — removed in `2a2bd9b5`. objc2→objc pointer cast was causing `panic_cannot_unwind`.
- [ ] **no recreate_tray** — recreating tray pushes icon LEFT (behind notch). must only create once (`f2f7f770`).
- [ ] **tray upgrade button opens in-app checkout** — Verify that clicking the tray's upgrade button correctly opens the in-app checkout experience. (`078fcfb2`)
- [ ] **modernized tray menu** — Verify the tray menu's updated layout and functionality match the modernized design. (`b6c363e5`)
- [ ] **Recording toggle in tray** — Verify that the tray menu has a single toggle to start/stop recording (replacing separate items). (`cdc1d0fd9`)
- [ ] **Headless webview teardown** — Enable Headless, close Home, and verify every app webview process exits while recording, scheduled pipes, and the existing tray icon remain active. Global shortcuts must do nothing while dormant; opening screenpipe from the tray must recreate Home and restore shortcuts.
- [ ] **Headless record-only mode** — Enable Headless → Record only, close Home, and verify recording and the tray remain active while scheduled pipe occurrences are consumed as no-ops. Open screenpipe from the tray and verify pipes wait for their next future schedule without a catch-up burst.

### 3. monitor plug/unplug

commits: `28e5c247`

- [ ] **unplug external monitor while recording** — recording continues on remaining monitor(s). no crash. log shows "Monitor X disconnected".
- [ ] **plug in external monitor while recording** — new monitor is detected within 5 seconds. recording starts on it. log shows "Monitor X reconnected".
- [ ] **unplug and replug same monitor** — recording resumes. same monitor ID reused. no duplicate recording tasks.
- [ ] **unplug all external monitors (laptop only)** — built-in display continues recording. no crash.
- [ ] **plug monitor with different resolution** — recording starts at correct resolution. OCR works on new monitor.
- [ ] **"use all monitors" setting** — with this ON, all monitors auto-detected. no manual configuration needed.
- [ ] **specific monitor IDs setting** — with specific IDs configured, only those monitors are recorded. unplugging a non-configured monitor has no effect.
- [ ] **resolution change (e.g., clamshell mode)** — closing MacBook lid with external monitor. recording continues on external.
- [ ] **queue stats after unplug** — check logs. no queue stats for disconnected monitor after disconnect.
- [ ] **--use-all-monitors flag override** — Verify that the `--use-all-monitors` CLI flag correctly overrides tier-based defaults (e.g., if a tier defaults to a single monitor, the flag should still enable all monitors). (`bd5b94328`)

### 4. audio device handling

- [ ] **CoreAudio Process Tap (experimental)** — with `experimentalCoreaudioSystemAudio` ON on macOS 14.4+, System Audio uses the CoreAudio Process Tap and rebuilds if silence is detected; with the flag OFF (default) System Audio uses SCK. (`75a52603b`, `5634664da`)
- [ ] **meeting piggyback OFF (default)** — with `experimentalMeetingPiggyback` off, a meeting starts/ends with zero device-set changes: no "Meeting Tap" device, no suspensions, logs contain no `meeting_piggyback` actions.
- [ ] **meeting piggyback ON, detected meeting** — flag on ("Smart recording" in settings), ANY capture mode, macOS 14.4+: join a Zoom call with a NON-default mic selected in Zoom → within ~4s a "Meeting Tap (output)" session stream starts, and within ~6s (two confirmation ticks — we never race the app's own device acquisition) the Zoom-selected mic is capturing; the global "System Audio (output)" stream and non-resolved mics are suspended; transcripts attribute to "Meeting Tap"/the resolved mic; on meeting end everything reverts and the resolved mic is NOT left in enabled devices (settings unchanged).
- [ ] **meeting apps always keep the mic (calm near-end)** — flag on, AirPods (or any BT mic) as the enabled/default mic: join a Google Meet/Zoom call and stay in it 10+ minutes, then switch mics inside the app a few times. The app must NEVER lose its microphone ("can't connect to microphone", capture dying) and the logs must show ZERO screenpipe open/close cycles of the app's current mic during the call — no per-tick `starting recording`/`Stopping device` churn on it, no suspend/resume oscillation of the other mics (displacement is a one-shot latch), and any failed mic open retries at 10s/30s/60s backoff, never every 2s. (Root cause 2026-07-07: the old near-end opened the resolved mic the tick it appeared and re-evaluated displacement per tick — each cycle a real BT open/close → SCO renegotiation storm that starved Meet/Zoom; see `MicFollow` in `meeting_piggyback.rs`.)
- [ ] **piggyback takes precedence over capture mode** — flag on, capture mode "always" (continuous): joining a meeting engages the piggyback exactly as in meetings-only (Meeting Tap + resolved mic, global output and non-resolved mics suspended); on meeting end continuous capture resumes on the user's configured devices with no leftover session streams or suspensions.
- [ ] **manual meeting piggyback (all mic-holders)** — flag on, start a MANUAL meeting while an app holds the mic: within ~6s (two-tick pid adoption) a Meeting Tap session starts over ALL mic-holding processes and their resolved mics are captured; a second app opening a mic mid-meeting rebuilds the tap over the widened set (one `rebuilding tap` log, NO strike, no System Audio resume/suspend churn); ending the manual meeting reverts everything. Screenpipe's own processes must never appear in the tapped set.
- [ ] **enabled resolved mic displaces others (D1, latched)** — two mics enrolled, meeting app using one of them (no session stream needed): once the resolved mic delivers, the OTHER enrolled mic is suspended ONCE (single transcription stream, no re-suspend churn); a transient stall of the resolved mic (BT renegotiation) does NOT resume the others — they come back only when the app releases its mics, the resolved capture stays dead for 60s+, or the meeting ends; after such a lift, the meeting app recovering onto an enrolled mic re-latches displacement once.
- [ ] **piggyback fallback: tap build failure** — flag on, force tap failure (revoke System Audio Recording permission): capture continues on the user's configured capture — the System Audio stream via whichever backend their settings select (SCK by default, CoreAudio global tap when `experimentalCoreaudioSystemAudio` is on) plus their configured/pinned mics; a warning logs, ≤3 retries per meeting with 60s cooldown, no notification unless the fallback capture is also silent.
- [ ] **piggyback fallback is backend-neutral** — repeat the tap-build-failure test with `experimentalCoreaudioSystemAudio` ON: the fallback System Audio stream comes up as the CoreAudio global tap (log shows a Process Tap gen start, not SCK), proving the piggyback fallback re-derives the backend from user settings at start time rather than hardcoding one. Same expectation for any future backend.
- [ ] **piggyback fallback: app quits mid-meeting** — kill the meeting app: tap stream tears down within ~2s, global output resumes (unsuspended) until the watcher ends the meeting; no crash, no rebuild storm.
- [ ] **piggyback fallback: no pid (ui_scan/reattach)** — a DETECTED meeting whose sensor can't identify the process (ui_scan, post-restart reattach) behaves exactly like flag-off (stable path). Manual meetings are NOT in this bucket — they derive their pid set from the live mic-holder enumeration (see the manual-piggyback item above).
- [ ] **browser pop-out / Little Arc meeting detection** — join a Google Meet call in a Chrome pop-out window or an Arc "Little Arc" window, then focus a different app: the meeting is detected within one poll of the mic being held (log shows the `UnresolvedBrowser` -> `Active` promotion); a non-meeting window whose title merely looks like a meeting code (e.g. a doc named "abc-defg-hij") with no mic held must NOT trigger detection. (`ff0337416`)
- [ ] **piggyback on unsupported OS** — flag on, macOS <14.4 / Windows <20348: one-time log "using the stable capture path", capture identical to flag-off. Windows must fail the PID-specific tap and let the normal configured/default output capture path run; the Meeting Tap stream itself must not silently downgrade to endpoint-wide loopback.
- [ ] **mid-call mic switch in the app** — change Zoom's mic mid-call: capture follows within ~6s (two confirmation ticks AFTER Zoom has the new device — the app always acquires first; old session mic stops after two missed resolver ticks, new one starts); changing the OS default while Zoom is pinned elsewhere does NOT switch capture. Switching onto a mic the sweep had displaced only clears its suspension flag — no immediate restart racing the app.
- [ ] **mic switch must not flap the meeting** — switch the meeting app's mic (AirPods → phone → built-in, several times): `meeting_status_changed` stays active=true throughout — NO end/re-start pair ~20s after each switch, no Meeting Tap teardown/rebuild, no System Audio resume/suspend churn. (Root cause was device-derived session keys: macOS synthesized the audio-session id from the device set and WASAPI GUIDs are per-endpoint, so a mic switch re-keyed the session and the meeting rode the 20s ending grace into EndMeeting + instant restart.)
- [ ] **piggyback never acts on silence** — during a piggybacked call, silence must never make the piggyback rebuild, restart, probe, or notify: mute in the meeting app (or leave a silent tab rendering nothing) for 5+ min → NO notification, NO Meeting Tap rebuild, NO resolved-mic restart, and the logs contain no silence-driven piggyback actions. A silent meeting device is the user's own in-meeting feedback loop — they fix it in the app and the mic/output follow tracks the switch. (The GLOBAL System Audio tap's silence watchdog — item above, `75a52603b` — is unchanged and out of scope here.) Dead-stream handling still applies: hard open failures notify once via `audio_capture_health_mic_capture_failed`, and dead capture streams retry through `MicFollow`'s backoff.
- [ ] **Windows per-process tap supervisor** — Windows 20348+: verify target-exit detection (app quits -> Meeting Tap stops and stable capture resumes) and default-endpoint loopback re-anchor for explicit global loopback. There is deliberately NO per-pid silence watchdog (see the item above — the piggyback never acts on silence). Confirm tap startup failure falls back through the user's normal/default audio settings, not through an implicit low-level endpoint-loopback downgrade inside the Meeting Tap.
- [ ] **piggyback telemetry** — flag on (any capture mode): end a piggybacked meeting → one `piggyback_meeting_summary` appears in PostHog Live Events with the correct outcome; a failed meeting-mic open appears as `audio_capture_health_mic_capture_failed` (there are no mic-silent events — the piggyback never acts on silence); analytics toggle OFF → nothing is sent (engine `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` gate).


- [ ] **default audio device** — with "follow system default", recording uses whatever macOS says is default.
- [ ] **plug in USB headset** — if set to follow defaults and macOS switches to headset, recording follows.
- [ ] **unplug USB headset** — recording falls back to built-in mic/speakers. no crash. no 30s timeout errors.
- [ ] **bluetooth device connect/disconnect** — AirPods connect mid-recording. audio continues without gap.
- [ ] **no audio device available** — unplug all audio. app continues (vision still works). log shows warning, not crash.
- [ ] **audio stream timeout recovery** — if audio stream times out (30s no data), it should reconnect automatically.
- [ ] **multiple audio devices simultaneously** — input (mic) + output (speakers) both recording. both show in device list.
- [ ] **disable audio setting** — toggling "disable audio" stops all audio recording. re-enabling restarts it.
- [ ] **Metal GPU for whisper** — transcription uses GPU acceleration on macOS (`f882caef`). verify with Activity Monitor GPU tab.
- [ ] **Qwen3-asr OpenBLAS** — On Linux/Windows, verify that qwen3-asr uses OpenBLAS for improved transcription performance. (`e64ee25f4`)
- [ ] **Batch transcription mode** — Verify that batch transcription mode works correctly with both cloud and Deepgram engines.
- [ ] **Cloud transcription batch capping** — Send large audio chunks (>200s) to cloud transcription. Verify they are correctly capped/split and do not trigger Cloudflare 413 errors. (`792145ac6`)
- [ ] **Lower RMS threshold for batch mode output devices** — In batch transcription mode, verify that output devices correctly use a lower RMS threshold.
- [ ] **OpenAI-compatible STT connection test** — Configure OpenAI-compatible STT, then use the connection test feature. Verify it accurately reports connection status.
- [ ] **OpenAI-compatible STT editable model input** — When using OpenAI-compatible STT, verify that the model input fields are editable.
- [ ] **OpenAI-compatible STT with custom vocabulary** — Configure OpenAI-compatible STT with a custom vocabulary. Verify that transcription accuracy improves when this vocabulary is present in the audio. Verify that vocabulary is sent as both prompt and context. (`d3a4b6bcc`)
- [ ] **OpenAI-compatible transcription engine support** — Enable and configure the OpenAI-compatible transcription engine. Verify that audio is correctly captured and transcribed using this engine.
- [ ] **"transcribing..." only for recent chunks** — Verify that the "transcribing..." caption/indicator only appears for audio chunks that are less than 2 minutes old. (`b70116b`)
- [ ] **no transcribing caption on old silent chunks** — Verify that old silent audio chunks do not trigger or display a "transcribing..." caption. (`54a550f4`)
- [ ] **silent chunks deleted, not stored** — After periods of silence, verify that no empty transcription rows are stored in the database for silent audio chunks, and they are instead correctly deleted. (`cb2cc205`)
- [ ] **silent chunk zombie loop prevention** — Verify that silent audio chunks do not lead to a "zombie loop" resulting in excessive CPU usage or large log files. (`6b3a71eb`)
- [ ] **write-ahead transcription cache performance** — Verify that the write-ahead transcription cache improves the performance and responsiveness of audio transcription. (`46350671`)
- [ ] **enhanced audio pipeline diagnostics** — Check logs and verify that enhanced audio pipeline diagnostics provide useful and accurate information. (`2e68400c`)
- [ ] **audio start/stop shortcuts toggle capture** — Verify that the audio start/stop shortcuts correctly toggle audio capture on and off. (`3701cce2`)
- [ ] **bulk import transcription dictionary** — Verify that the bulk import functionality for the transcription dictionary works correctly, including smart delimiter detection. (`73adc9d4`)
- [ ] **Audio start/stop shortcuts** — Verify that designated audio start/stop shortcuts reliably toggle audio capture on and off. Check logs for corresponding start/stop events.
- [ ] **Filter music toggle UI** — Verify that a "filter music" toggle exists in recording settings and correctly enables/disables music filtering.
- [ ] **Music detection thresholds** — With "filter music" enabled, play various types of music. Verify that music is correctly detected and filtered, and that non-music speech is still captured.
- [ ] **Audio reconciliation FK constraint loop** — Verify that audio reconciliation does not enter an infinite retry loop on foreign key constraints. (`e9e2dc252`)
- [ ] **Skip reconciliation when transcription disabled** — Disable audio transcription in settings. Verify that audio reconciliation is skipped. (`ceb77559d`)
- [ ] **dead System Audio auto-reconnect** — Simulate a dead system audio stream. Verify it auto-reconnects and resumes capture. (`0f287761d`)
- [ ] **SCK System Audio dead-display recovery (clamshell)** — Mid-call, close the MacBook lid with an external display attached → remote-participant (System Audio) audio resumes within ~1 min via auto re-anchor, mic unaffected. AND: leave the machine idle (nothing playing) for 10 min with stable displays → NO System Audio rebuild/churn (guards the reverted output recv-timeout `0f287761d` / `357e4dfcc`). Watchdog: `core::sck_output_watchdog` (#3901).
- [ ] **per-device audio toggle** — In the tray menu, verify you can toggle recording for individual audio devices. (`3ee3defcb`)
- [ ] **per-monitor tray toggle** — With 2+ displays, open the tray recording section and uncheck one monitor. Verify only that display stops screen capture; re-check resumes it. Pause one display individually, then global pause/resume — the individually paused display stays off. (`4685`)
- [ ] **stable audio device order** — Verify that audio devices listed in the tray menu maintain a stable order across refreshes. (`4577ac8a6`)
- [ ] **Mic disconnect false-positives on sleep/wake** — Put the computer to sleep and wake it up. Verify that no false-positive mic disconnect notifications or logs are generated. (`796baa619`)


#### Audio device recovery (monitor unplug / device switch)

commits: device_monitor.rs atomic swap, tiered backoff, empty device list guard

- [ ] **unplug monitor during active Zoom call** — output audio recovers within 15 seconds. Verify: `grep "DEVICE_RECOVERY.*output.*restored" ~/.screenpipe/screenpipe-app.*.log`. Verify: `curl localhost:3030/search?content_type=audio&limit=5` shows output device transcriptions resume.
- [ ] **unplug and replug monitor within 5 seconds** — no audio gap. both input and output continue. Verify: no "stopping" log for input device.
- [ ] **unplug monitor, wait 2 minutes, replug** — output recovers both times. Verify: two `DEVICE_RECOVERY` log entries.
- [ ] **switch audio output (AirPods → speakers) during call** — output audio continues with <5s gap. Old device kept running until new one starts (atomic swap).
- [ ] **health endpoint during output recovery** — `curl localhost:3030/health` shows `device_status_details` with output device present within 15 seconds of recovery.
- [ ] **SCK transient failure doesn't cascade** — if ScreenCaptureKit returns empty device list, running devices are NOT disconnected. Verify: `grep "device list returned empty" ~/.screenpipe/screenpipe-app.*.log` shows warning but no disconnections.
- [ ] **DB gap query after device switch** — run: `sqlite3 ~/.screenpipe/db.sqlite "SELECT t1.timestamp as gap_start, t2.timestamp as gap_end, (julianday(t2.timestamp) - julianday(t1.timestamp)) * 86400 as gap_seconds FROM audio_transcriptions t1 JOIN audio_transcriptions t2 ON t2.id = (SELECT MIN(id) FROM audio_transcriptions WHERE id > t1.id AND is_input_device = 0) WHERE t1.is_input_device = 0 AND (julianday(t2.timestamp) - julianday(t1.timestamp)) * 86400 > 60 ORDER BY t1.timestamp;"` — should return no rows if output was continuously captured.
- [ ] **Bluetooth audio device hijack recovery** — Join a video call (e.g., Zoom, Proton Meet) on AirPods, end the call, join another call ~1 min later on same AirPods. Verify the second call is fully captured (audio_chunks created throughout). CoreAudio sometimes delivers zero-fill when another app has exclusive claim; the watchdog detects sustained silence (>30s of exact zeros) after initial healthy audio and rebuilds the device. Regression: `a2e89b2ae` (initial detection), fixed by `357e4dfcc` (only trip watchdog after stream is healthy). USB devices that never produce real audio should NOT trigger rebuild storms.
- [ ] **Manual-mode pinned-input fallback** — In manual mode (NOT "Follow System Default"), pin only AirPods (input) as your mic. Mid-recording, turn off the AirPods. Verify: within ~20-25s the monitor engages the system default mic as a substitute and capture continues. Re-connect AirPods. Verify the substitute is torn down and capture returns to AirPods. Log markers: `grep "PINNED_FALLBACK" ~/.screenpipe/screenpipe-app.*.log` shows `pinned input '...' missing > 20s, capturing from system default '...' until it returns` then `clearing fallback '...': pinned input returned`. Edge: if you also user-disabled the default mic (privacy mode), expect "system default ... is user-disabled — no fallback engaged" log + zero capture rather than auto-fallback.
- [ ] **Pinned-input fallback when the dead device IS the system default (or there is none)** — Same as above, but make AirPods BOTH the pinned input AND the macOS default input (the common real case), then turn them off. Verify capture continues from the built-in mic within ~20-25s — NOT zero capture. The decider now fails over to any *available* input when the system default is unusable (it IS the dead pinned device — Bluetooth lingers as the registered default — or CoreAudio reports no default). Reconnect AirPods → substitute torn down. Sub-checks: (a) prefers an on-board mic over virtual/aggregate inputs (e.g. BlackHole/Aggregate present → built-in chosen); (b) still respects privacy — if the only other input is user-disabled, expect zero capture, not auto-fallback; (c) transient empty device list (SCK failure) → no fallback that cycle, no disconnect cascade; (d) sleep/wake flap < grace does not engage a spurious fallback. Regression: `ba23c8531` (ruark 6/18 "no recording either side of the call", frames=0/samples=0 — AirPods were the only input AND the default).

#### meeting detection & speaker identification

commits: calendar_speaker_id.rs, meetings.rs, meeting_persister.rs

- [ ] **restart during active meeting** — start a 1:1 calendar meeting (2 attendees), quit app mid-meeting, relaunch. meeting re-detected via calendar event still in progress. speaker names assigned. verify: `grep "meeting detected via calendar" ~/.screenpipe/screenpipe-app.*.log` shows detection after restart. verify: `sqlite3 ~/.screenpipe/db.sqlite "SELECT id, name FROM speakers WHERE name != ''"` shows both user and attendee names.
- [ ] **calendar-only meeting detection** — schedule a 1:1 meeting with 2 attendees, no meeting app (Zoom/Meet) open. meeting detected purely via calendar. verify: `grep "meeting_started" ~/.screenpipe/screenpipe-app.*.log`.
- [ ] **calendar meeting auto-end** — calendar meeting detected, wait past the calendar event end time. meeting_ended fires. verify: `grep "meeting ended via calendar" ~/.screenpipe/screenpipe-app.*.log`.
- [ ] **speaker naming in 1:1** — during 1:1 call with userName set in settings, input speaker named as user, output speaker named as other attendee. verify: `curl 'localhost:3030/search?content_type=audio&speaker_name=<attendee>&limit=5'` returns results.
- [ ] **auto-name input speaker** — with userName set, after ~2 minutes of speaking into mic, dominant input speaker named. verify: `grep "auto speaker identification: named" ~/.screenpipe/screenpipe-app.*.log`.
- [ ] **speaker names survive restart** — speaker named pre-restart stays named post-restart. verify: `sqlite3 ~/.screenpipe/db.sqlite "SELECT id, name FROM speakers WHERE name != ''"` shows same speakers before and after restart.
- [ ] **no duplicate speaker naming on restart** — restart during meeting, speakers already named aren't overwritten or duplicated. verify: no duplicate names in speakers table.

### 5. frame comparison & OCR pipeline

commits: `6dd5d98e`, `831ad258`

commits: `6dd5d98e`, `831ad258`

- [ ] **static screen = low CPU** — leave a static image on screen for 60s. CPU should drop below 5% (release build). hash early exit should kick in.
- [ ] **active screen = OCR runs** — actively browse/type. OCR results appear in search within 5 seconds of screen change.
- [ ] **identical frames skipped** — check logs for hash match frequency on idle monitors. should be >80% skip rate.
- [ ] **ultrawide monitor (3440x1440+)** — OCR works correctly. no distortion in change detection. text at edges is captured.
- [ ] **4K monitor** — OCR works. frame comparison doesn't timeout or spike CPU.
- [ ] **high refresh rate (120Hz+)** — app respects its own FPS setting (0.5 default), not the display refresh rate.
- [ ] **very fast content changes** — scroll quickly through a document. OCR captures content, no crashes from buffer overflows.
- [ ] **corrupt pixel buffer** — sck-rs handles corrupt ScreenCaptureKit buffers gracefully (no SIGABRT). fixed in `831ad258`.
- [ ] **window capture only on changed frames** — window enumeration (CGWindowList) should NOT run on skipped frames. verify by checking CPU on idle multi-monitor setup.
- [ ] **Meeting app OCR force** — Open a meeting app (Zoom, Teams, Meet). Verify OCR is forced for these apps even if accessibility is available. (`b18ae2253`)
- [ ] **Accessibility automation properties** — Verify automation properties (labels, roles, automation IDs) are correctly captured in the accessibility tree across Windows, macOS, and Linux. (`1b7d0db5b`)
- [ ] **Apple Vision per-word OCR fast path** — Browse an app with lots of text (e.g., Wikipedia article with 500+ words). Verify OCR database inserts are fast (bulk VALUES insert, not 500 individual RETURNING queries). Check logs for no "Slow DB batch insert" warnings. Regression: `6f3f80dd3` (Apple per-word records now use level="0" for bulk-insert fast path, not level="5" which hit expensive per-row insert).
- [ ] **DB write coalesce queue** — Under heavy load (e.g. many pipes + high FPS), verify no "database is locked" errors and no vision stalls due to write contention. (`39c016cb3`, `d119d060d`, `231521192`)
- [ ] **static-screen does not trigger vision-stall WARN** — Sit on a Zoom call / slide deck / IDE waiting screen for >2 minutes (no UI activity). Verify the engine does NOT log `health_check: no unique vision frame in Ns` warnings, and the Tauri app's `consecutive_vision_stall` counter stays at 0 (no `vision capture recovered after N stale checks` info line). Dedup-skipped captures must tick `last_db_write_ts` so the health check distinguishes "static screen, dedup working" from "pipeline stuck". Pre-fix: 8–14 false alarms/day with single stretches up to 28 minutes. (`a08ec9140`, +follow-up commit)
- [ ] **Windows idle CPU reduction** — Verify low CPU usage on Windows when screen is idle, using event-driven hooks and caching. (`d2c9d1fb8`)
- [ ] **reduced CPU spikes in vision/capture pipeline** — Actively browse and use applications, verifying that CPU spikes in the vision/capture pipeline are significantly reduced. (`8f7294e6`)
- [ ] **OCR bounding boxes normalized on Windows/Linux** — On Windows and Linux, verify that OCR bounding boxes are correctly normalized to the 0-1 range, ensuring consistent text overlay and interaction. (`aba74513`)
- [ ] **Debounced monitor capture errors** — Simulate transient monitor capture errors. Verify that these errors are debounced and do not lead to excessive error logging or app crashes.
- [ ] **Focus-aware capture** — Enable "Only record focused monitor" in settings. Verify that Screenpipe only captures frames and runs OCR for the monitor that currently has the focused window. (`886b5c05d`)
- [ ] **no stranded WGC session after persistent-capture disable (Windows)** — Force repeated persistent WGC init failures on one monitor (e.g. flaky driver, monitor sleep during init) while captures overlap (event-driven engine's capture timeout drops the future but the detached blocking closure keeps running, so two closures can race on the same monitor's shared state). After the "persistent capture disabled for monitor N" warning, verify no live WGC session remains: GPU usage for the app drops to per-frame-capture levels and no `CopyResource` work continues for that monitor. The disable path drains any concurrently stored session under the mutex, and the store path re-checks the disable flag under the same mutex — a session stored behind `persistent_capture_disabled == true` would otherwise leak GPU textures until refresh/stream release.

### 6. Battery Saver Mode

commits: `d5a9d052`, `0b32cc9a`, `ca29a67b`

- [ ] **Battery Saver mode functionality** — Enable Battery Saver mode. Verify that capture adjustments (e.g., reduced FPS, paused capture) occur as expected when the device's power state changes (e.g., unplugging/plugging power, low battery).
- [ ] **Faster power state UI updates** — Change the device's power state (e.g., unplug/plug power). Verify that the UI updates quickly and accurately reflects the current power state and capture mode.
- [ ] **Correct default power mode** — On a fresh install or after a reset, verify that the default power mode is set to "performance" until Battery Saver mode is explicitly enabled or configured.

### 7. permissions (macOS)

commits: `d9d43d31`, `620c89a5`, `14acf6f0`

- [ ] **fresh install — all prompts appear** — screen recording, microphone, accessibility prompts all show on first launch.
- [ ] **denied permission → opens System Settings** — if user previously denied mic permission, clicking "grant" opens System Settings > Privacy directly (`620c89a5`).
- [ ] **permission revoked while running** — go to System Settings, revoke screen recording. app shows red permission banner within 10 seconds.
- [ ] **permission banner is visible** — solid red `bg-destructive` banner at top of main window when any permission missing. not subtle (`9c0ba5d1`).
- [ ] **permission recovery page** — navigating to /permission-recovery shows clear instructions.
- [ ] **startup permission gate** — on first launch, permissions are requested before recording starts (`d9d43d31`).
- [ ] **faster permission polling** — permission status checked every 5-10 seconds, not 30 (`d9d43d31`).
- [ ] **No recurring permission modal after close** — Grant macOS permissions, quit the app, and relaunch it multiple times. Verify that the macOS permission modal does NOT reappear every time the app is closed.
- [ ] **mic-grant restart survives a slow boot** — with mic permission already granted from a prior session, relaunch with a slow boot (large DB migration or first-run model download) so the window gains focus before `ServerCore` finishes constructing. Verify capture actually starts once boot completes instead of silently staying off. Check `grep "start_capture after mic grant" ~/.screenpipe/screenpipe-app.*.log` — should show success, not "gave up after N attempts" (previously a fixed ~10s budget that raced boot and gave up permanently — found during the Intel-Mac CI smoke-test investigation, screenpipe#4978). If an attempt does time out, verify a **later window focus retries** rather than being silently disabled for the rest of the session (regression: the old `MIC_FOCUS_CAPTURE_RESTART` latch was set once and never reset).

- [ ] **fresh install — all prompts appear** — screen recording, microphone, accessibility prompts all show on first launch.
- [ ] **denied permission → opens System Settings** — if user previously denied mic permission, clicking "grant" opens System Settings > Privacy directly (`620c89a5`).
- [ ] **permission revoked while running** — go to System Settings, revoke screen recording. app shows red permission banner within 10 seconds.
- [ ] **permission banner is visible** — solid red `bg-destructive` banner at top of main window when any permission missing. not subtle (`9c0ba5d1`).
- [ ] **permission recovery page** — navigating to /permission-recovery shows clear instructions.
- [ ] **startup permission gate** — on first launch, permissions are requested before recording starts (`d9d43d31`).
- [ ] **faster permission polling** — permission status checked every 5-10 seconds, not 30 (`d9d43d31`).
- [ ] **improved permission recovery UX** — Verify that the user experience for recovering from denied permissions is clear and intuitive. (`57cca740`)

### 15. Windows-specific

commits: `eea0c865`, `fe9060db`, `c99c3967`, `aeaa446b`, `5a219688`, `caae1ebc`, `67caf1d1`, `ff4af7b5`

- [ ] **COM thread conflict** — audio and vision threads don't conflict on COM initialization (`eea0c865`).
- [ ] **high-DPI display (150%, 200%)** — OCR captures at correct resolution.
- [ ] **multiple monitors** — all detected and recorded.
- [ ] **Windows Defender** — app not blocked by default security.
- [ ] **Windows default mode** — On Windows, the app should default to window mode on first launch.
- [ ] **Windows taskbar icon** — The app should display a taskbar icon on Windows.
- [ ] **Windows audio transcription accuracy** — On Windows, verify improved audio transcription accuracy due to native Silero VAD frame size and lower speech threshold.
- [ ] **Windows multi-line pipe prompts** — Multi-line pipe prompts should be preserved on Windows.
- [ ] **Windows ARM64 support** — On a Windows ARM64 device, verify the app installs and runs correctly. (`d62360bc4`)
- [ ] **Windows app matching for meetings** — On Windows, verify that meeting detection correctly matches active applications. (`ef39e728d`)
- [ ] **Alt+S shortcut activates overlay with keyboard focus** — On Windows, press `Alt+S`. Verify that the overlay window appears and immediately receives keyboard focus, allowing immediate typing.
- [ ] **OcrTextBlock deserialization handles Windows OCR format** — On Windows, verify that `OcrTextBlock` deserialization correctly handles the specific Windows OCR format. (`c49ccb55`)
- [ ] **populate accessibility tree bounds for text overlay on Windows** — On Windows, verify that accessibility tree bounds are correctly populated for text overlay, ensuring accurate positioning and interaction. (`4d20803a`)

- [ ] **Settings window instead of overlay** — On Windows, verify that the Settings window is used instead of the overlay for settings, and the shortcut toggle works correctly. (`c13e21b55`)
- [ ] **background work is deprioritized on Windows; app process and UI stay at Normal** — (#4849) CLI `screenpipe record` drops itself to BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS (verify `(Get-Process screenpipe).PriorityClass` → `BelowNormal`, CI asserts in `windows-integration-test.yml`; opt-out `SCREENPIPE_KEEP_NORMAL_PRIORITY=1`). The desktop app process must stay `Normal` — it gets targeted lowering only: audio-encode ffmpeg children spawn `BelowNormal`, compaction ffmpeg stays `Idle`, pipe/agent bun subtree spawns `BelowNormal` (interactive chat's pi sidecar stays `Normal` — separate spawner in src-tauri/pi.rs), whisper inference dips its thread per-call, LL input-hook threads pinned HIGHEST (system-wide input path — Windows silently unhooks starved LL hooks). Verify children: `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='ffmpeg.exe' OR Name='bun.exe'"` + `(Get-Process -Id …).PriorityClass` while recording with a pipe enabled. If audio capture gaps appear under all-core CPU load in the CLI, see #4916 (cpal fork's broken thread-priority boost — capture threads not insulated from the class drop).
- [ ] **foreground apps stay responsive while a11y capture runs (UIA tree walks off by default)** — Full-window UIA tree walks are synchronous cross-process calls serviced on the *target app's* UI thread. The old 2s periodic + focus-change walks caused p95 213ms message-pump stalls (~97 freezes >100ms per 2 min) in Edge and were ~100% of severe foreground freezes; their snapshots also had zero consumers (`paired_capture.rs` owns a11y text capture). `capture_tree`/`tree_capture_interval_ms` now default to `false`/`0` (`crates/screenpipe-a11y/src/config.rs`), including the startup walk. Preserved: per-click `ElementFromPoint` enrichment and a debounced single-element focused-element refresh on focus change (feeds click/app_switch/window_focus element context). Verify: (a) `scripts/windows/cpu-investigation/walker-fix-verification/verify-walker-fix.ps1` (self-contained before/after harness with PASS/FAIL gate; measured p95 156ms → 1.6ms, stalls>100ms 108 → 4 per 2min) or the raw probe `scripts/windows/cpu-investigation/experiments/measure-ui-latency.ps1`; (b) `ui_events` rows still carry `element` context for clicks and app switches (`cargo run -p screenpipe-a11y --example windows_probe_harness`); (c) anyone re-enabling `capture_tree` must keep the startup walk gated on it.

#### Windows text extraction matrix (accessibility vs OCR)

The event-driven pipeline (`paired_capture.rs`) decides per-frame whether to use accessibility tree text or OCR. Terminal apps force OCR because their accessibility tree only returns window chrome.

commits: `5a219688` (wire up Windows OCR), `caae1ebc` (prefer OCR for terminals), `67caf1d1` (no chrome fallback)

**App categories and expected behavior:**

| App category | Examples | `app_prefers_ocr` | Text source | Expected text |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Browser | Chrome, Edge, Firefox | false | Accessibility | Full page content + chrome |
| Code editor | VS Code, Fleet | false | Accessibility | Editor content, tabs, sidebar |
| Terminal (listed) | WezTerm, Windows Terminal, Alacritty | true | Windows OCR | Terminal buffer content via screenshot |
| Terminal (unlisted) | cmd.exe, powershell.exe | false | Accessibility | Whatever UIA exposes (may be limited) |
| System UI | Explorer, taskbar, Settings | false | Accessibility | UI labels, text fields |
| Games / low-a11y apps | Games, Electron w/o a11y | false | Windows OCR (fallback) | OCR from screenshot |
| Lock screen | LockApp.exe | false | Accessibility | Time, date, battery |

**Terminal detection list** (`app_prefers_ocr` matches, case-insensitive):
`wezterm`, `iterm`, `terminal`, `alacritty`, `kitty`, `hyper`, `warp`, `ghostty`

Note: `"terminal"` matches `WindowsTerminal.exe` but NOT `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`.

**Test checklist:**

- [ ] **WezTerm OCR capture** — open WezTerm, type commands. search for terminal content within 30s. should return OCR text, NOT "System Minimize Restore Close" chrome.
- [ ] **Windows Terminal OCR** — same test with Windows Terminal.
- [ ] **Chrome/Edge full accessibility** — open Chrome or Edge, browse a page. search returns full page content from accessibility tree, not just limited UI elements.
- [ ] **VS Code full accessibility** — open VS Code with a file. search returns full code content and UI elements from accessibility tree.
- [ ] **Game/no-a11y OCR fallback** — open an app with poor accessibility. OCR should run and extract text from screenshot.
- [ ] **OCR engine name** — query DB: OCR entries should have engine `WindowsNative` (not `AppleNative`).
- [ ] **Failed OCR = no noise** — if OCR fails for a terminal, the frame should have NULL text, not chrome like "System Minimize Restore Close".
- [ ] **Non-terminal chrome-only** — rare case where a normal app returns only chrome from accessibility. stored as-is (acceptable, no OCR fallback triggered).
- [ ] **Empty accessibility + empty OCR** — app with no tree text and OCR failure. frame stored with NULL text. no crash.
- [ ] **OCR text persisted on frames** — `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM frames WHERE full_text IS NOT NULL AND full_text != ''` should be non-zero after a few minutes of use on Windows. (The `ocr_text` table was retired; OCR text now lives in `frames.full_text`, per-word boxes in `frames.text_json`.)

#### Windows text extraction — untested / unknown apps

These apps are common on Windows but have **never been tested** with the event-driven pipeline. We don't know if their accessibility tree returns useful text or just chrome. Each needs manual verification: open the app, use it for a few minutes, then `curl "http://localhost:3030/search?app_name=<name>&limit=3"` and check if the text is meaningful.

**Status legend:** `?` = untested, `OK` = verified good, `CHROME` = only returns chrome, `EMPTY` = no text, `OCR-NEEDED` = should be added to `app_prefers_ocr`

| App | Status | a11y text quality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Browsers** | | | |
| Chrome | OK | good (full page content) | 2778ch avg, rich a11y tree |
| Edge | ? | probably good | same Chromium UIA as Chrome |
| Firefox | ? | unknown | different a11y engine than Chromium |
| Brave / Vivaldi / Arc | ? | probably good | Chromium-based, needs verification |
| **Code editors** | | | |
| VS Code | ? | unknown | Electron, should have good UIA |
| JetBrains (IntelliJ, etc) | ? | unknown | Java Swing/AWT, UIA quality varies |
| Sublime Text | ? | unknown | custom UI, may need OCR fallback |
| Cursor | ? | unknown | Electron fork of VS Code |
| Zed | ? | unknown | custom GPU renderer, a11y unknown |
| **Terminals** | | | |
| WezTerm | CHROME | chrome only ("System Minimize...") | `app_prefers_ocr` = true, OCR works |
| Windows Terminal | ? | unknown | matches `"terminal"` in `app_prefers_ocr` |
| cmd.exe | ? | unknown | NOT matched by `app_prefers_ocr` |
| powershell.exe | ? | unknown | NOT matched by `app_prefers_ocr` |
| Git Bash (mintty) | ? | unknown | NOT matched by `app_prefers_ocr` |
| **Communication** | | | |
| Discord | ? | unknown | Electron, old OCR data exists |
| Slack | ? | unknown | Electron |
| Teams | ? | unknown | Electron/WebView2 |
| Zoom | ? | unknown | custom UI |
| Telegram | ? | unknown | Qt-based |
| WhatsApp | ? | unknown | Electron |
| **Productivity** | | | |
| Notion | ? | unknown | Electron |
| Obsidian | ? | unknown | Electron |
| Word / Excel / PowerPoint | ? | unknown | native Win32, historically good UIA |
| Outlook | ? | unknown | mixed native/web |
| OneNote | ? | unknown | UWP, should have good UIA |
| **Media / Creative** | | | |
| Figma | ? | unknown | Electron + canvas, likely poor a11y on canvas |
| Spotify | ? | unknown | Electron/CEF |
| VLC | ? | unknown | Qt-based |
| Adobe apps (Photoshop, etc) | ? | unknown | custom UI, historically poor a11y |
| **System / Utilities** | | | |
| Explorer | OK | good | file names, paths, status bar |
| Settings | ? | unknown | UWP, should be good |
| Task Manager | ? | unknown | UWP on Win11 |
| Notepad | ? | unknown | should have excellent UIA |
| **Games / GPU-rendered** | | | |
| Any game | ? | likely empty | GPU-rendered, no UIA tree. should fall to OCR |
| Electron w/ disabled a11y | ? | likely empty | some Electron apps disable a11y |

**Priority to test (most common user apps):**
1. VS Code — most developers will have this open
2. Discord / Slack — always running in background
3. Windows Terminal / cmd.exe / powershell.exe — verify terminal detection
4. Edge / Firefox — browser is primary use
5. Notion / Obsidian — knowledge workers
6. Office apps — enterprise users

**How to verify an app:**
```bash
# 1. Open the app, use it for 2 minutes
# 2. Check what was captured:
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?app_name=<exe_name>&limit=3&content_type=all"
# 3. If text is only chrome (System/Minimize/Close), it may need adding to app_prefers_ocr
# 4. If text is empty and screenshots exist, OCR fallback should kick in
# 5. Update this table with findings
```

**Apps that may need adding to `app_prefers_ocr` list:**
- If cmd.exe / powershell.exe return chrome-only text, add `"cmd"` and `"powershell"` to the list
- If mintty (Git Bash) returns chrome-only, add `"mintty"`
- Any app where the accessibility tree consistently returns only window chrome but screenshots contain readable text

## how to run

### before every release
1. run sections 1-4 completely (90% of regressions)
2. spot-check sections 5-10

### before merging window/tray/dock changes
run section 1 and 2 completely. these are the most fragile.

### before merging vision/OCR changes
run section 3, 5, and 14 (Windows text extraction matrix) completely.

### before merging audio changes
run section 4 completely.

### before merging AI changes
run section 10.

## known limitations (not bugs)

- tray icon on notched MacBooks can end up behind the notch if menu bar is crowded. Cmd+drag to reposition. dock menu is the fallback.
- macOS only shows permission prompts once (NotDetermined → Denied is permanent). must use System Settings to re-grant.
- debug builds use ~3-5x more CPU than release builds for vision pipeline.
- first frame after app launch always triggers OCR (intentional — no previous frame to compare against).
- chat panel is pre-created hidden at startup so it exists before user presses the shortcut. Creation no longer activates/shows — only the show_existing path does (matching main overlay pattern).
- shortcut reminder should use `CanJoinAllSpaces` (visible on all Spaces simultaneously). chat and main overlay should use `MoveToActiveSpace` (moved to current Space on show, then flag removed to pin).
