# Screenpipe Design Guide

## Philosophy

**"Escher monochrome with controlled phosphor intelligence"**

Screenpipe turns the trace of human work into memory, models, and agents. The
visual system should feel like a mathematical print becoming executable:
precise, recursive, slightly uncanny, and still controlled by the person whose
work created it.

Black and warm bone are the substrate. Trace grey carries evidence, selection,
and ready states. Neutral contrast carries ordinary hierarchy. Bright phosphor
appears only while captured work is actively becoming model context or an agent
is executing an explicit action. Soft work surfaces around sharp structural
geometry, clean typography, and Escher-inspired mathematical abstractions form
the core identity.

## Core Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Privacy First** | Local-first execution and data by default, cloud optional |
| **Human Agency** | Preserve ownership, control, and a visible path back to source material |
| **Open Source** | Inspect, modify, own, clean abstractions and readable codebase |
| **Simplicity** | Clean, minimal interface, powerful abstractions |
| **Radical optimism** | There is no such thing as impossible |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Easy, simple for non technical users but power users can still go deep |

---

## Typography

### Font Stack

| Purpose | Font | Fallbacks |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Headings (sans)** | Space Grotesk | system-ui, sans-serif |
| **Body (serif)** | Crimson Text | Baskerville, Times New Roman, serif |
| **Code (mono)** | IBM Plex Mono | monospace |

### Usage Patterns

- **Headings**: Space Grotesk, lowercase preferred
- **Body text**: Crimson Text for readability
- **Code/technical**: IBM Plex Mono
- **Buttons**: UPPERCASE with tracking-wide
- **Labels**: lowercase, medium weight

---

## Narrative model

| Visual role | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Bone | Human experience and source material |
| Trace grey | Captured evidence and intermediate structure |
| Neutral signal | Ready, selected, focused, or available action |
| Phosphor | Intelligence actively transforming or executing |
| Ink | The local system, recursion, and durable infrastructure |

The public story is preserving, multiplying, and executing human intelligence.
Do not frame the product as erasing people. Screenpipe handles intimate context,
so agency, ownership, and a visible path back to source material are part of the
interface, not legal footnotes.

## Colors

### Palette

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ink | `#0A0A0A` | Foreground, structure, dark canvas |
| Bone canvas | `#F6F6F3` | Main light background and human/source state |
| White surface | `#FFFFFF` | Raised work surfaces on the bone canvas |
| Trace | `#78786F` | Secondary evidence and inactive structure |
| Neutral signal | `#333333` light / `#B8B8B8` dark | Ready, selected, focus, active rail |
| Phosphor | `#C7FF3E` | Transformation or execution happening now |

Ordinary screens remain monochrome. Ink, bone, and trace carry the complete
idle composition. One small phosphor focal point may appear while work is
active. Do not perform a global color sweep without checking every state in
light and dark mode.

### Accessibility

- Use white text on the light-mode neutral signal and ink text on the dark-mode
  neutral signal.
- Use ink text on phosphor fills.
- Pair color with a label, icon, shape, or state change. Meaning must never rely
  on color alone.
- Keep error, warning, success, privacy, and billing states explicit in text.
  Phosphor is not a generic success color.

### Signal hierarchy

| Signal | Use | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Neutral ink/trace | Structure and ordinary action | large CTAs, input borders, labels |
| Neutral signal | Ready, selected, or focused | active rail, caret, selected row, chart hover |
| Bright phosphor | Active transformation or execution | streaming agent step, capture becoming memory |

Phosphor must go out when the work stops. Ready, completed, selected, and
ordinary focus states return to neutral ink or trace.

### Where phosphor belongs

- The boundary where capture becomes memory or model context
- The active step in an agent or automation pipeline
- A single focal point in a recursive or tessellated composition

### Where phosphor does not belong

- Every button, icon, link, or heading
- Large decorative backgrounds
- Generic badges or marketing emphasis
- Status decoration without a meaningful transformation
- Rainbow, aurora, or generic AI gradients

## Product surfaces

- Put the user's task, result, current state, and source path before explanation.
- Use progressive disclosure for traces, logs, provenance, and advanced controls.
- Keep real product proof and interactive state ahead of explanatory diagrams.
- Do not install persistent capture-to-context pipeline diagrams in primary app
  surfaces. If sequence matters, reveal it through the actual state transition.
- Use small geometry as structure or state, not as decoration competing with work.

## Geometry

### Border Radius

```
--radius: 0.5rem
```

Use a restrained, tiered radius system:

- **8px (`rounded-lg`)** for cards, dialogs, media, and primary work surfaces
- **6px (`rounded-md`)** for buttons, inputs, selects, and ordinary controls
- **4px (`rounded-sm`)** for compact menu items and dense control labels
- Legacy `rounded-xl`, `rounded-2xl`, and `rounded-3xl` utilities resolve to
  the 8px surface tier instead of introducing oversized corner styles
- **Pills/circles** only for short statuses, avatars, toggles, and true circular controls
- **0px** for app/window edges, split panes, rails, crop or measurement marks,
  timelines, charts, canvases, and Escher-inspired structural geometry

Radius should make a surface easier to parse, not turn every region into a
card. Nested surfaces should step down in radius or stay flat.

### Borders

- Width: 1px solid
- Style: Sharp, binary (on/off)
- No decorative gradients. A restrained transition may be used only when it
  communicates metamorphosis or state progression.

### Shadows

**Flat by default. Use 1px borders for ordinary separation.** Subtle shadows may
lift floating surfaces such as the chat input, overlays, popovers, and dialogs.
Keep them soft, low-opacity, mostly vertical, and within roughly 1 to 8px offset
and 24px blur. Radius follows the surface tier and does not increase merely to
sell elevation.

## Components

### Buttons

```
- Font: UPPERCASE, tracking-wide
- Border: 1px solid
- Corners: Compact (6px radius)
- Transition: 150ms
- Hover: Color inversion
- Neutral fill: primary ready action
- Phosphor: active execution indicator, not a generic CTA fill
```

### Cards

```
- Border: 1px solid
- Shadow: None
- Corners: Surface (8px radius)
- Padding: 16px by default; expand only when the content needs it
```

### Inputs

```
- Style: Command-line aesthetic
- Font: Monospace (IBM Plex Mono)
- Border: 1px solid
- Corners: Compact (6px radius)
- Height: 40px (h-10)
- Focus: Border color change
```

### Dialogs

```
- Border: 1px solid
- Shadow: Subtle lift allowed (elevated surface)
- Corners: Surface (8px radius)
- Animation: 150ms fade
- Title: lowercase
```

## Motion & Animation

### Principles

- **Fast**: 150ms standard duration
- **Minimal**: Only essential state changes
- **Causal**: Motion should show what changed, what triggered it, and where it went
- **Secondary**: Motion must not compete with the current task or result

### Timing

| Animation | Duration |
|-----------|----------|
| Button hover | 150ms |
| Dialog open/close | 150ms |
| Accordion | 200ms |
| Page transitions | 150ms |

### Iteration

Critique motion against the principles above, refine it until the cause and
result are obvious, then check the feature with reduced motion enabled and
provide a complete static state.

## Reference calibration

Reference products are restraint checks, not palettes to copy. Claude Desktop
uses warm neutrals with restrained terracotta identity. ChatGPT and Codex use
cooler greys with blue for interaction and state. Screenpipe should borrow their
neutral-to-accent ratio and calm elevation, not their hues.

Compare semantic color roles, surface hierarchy, and elevation scale. Keep
screenpipe's ink, bone, trace, neutral signal, and phosphor meanings intact.

## Brand Voice

### Tone

- Lowercase, casual, direct
- Minimal technical details but power users can go deep
- No marketing fluff
- Show source, trigger, action, destination, and user control where relevant
- Avoid surveillance language and claims that remove human agency
