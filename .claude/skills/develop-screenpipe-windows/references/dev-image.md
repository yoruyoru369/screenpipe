# Azure Windows dev image

The reusable unit is an immutable Windows 11 development image in Azure Compute
Gallery, not a clone of the live release runner. Build or refresh the image once;
each task launches a disposable VM from a validated image version and destroys
only that VM afterward.

The VM uses its own auto-logon console desktop for interactive validation and
recording. No operator session or inbound desktop access exists. After the
one-shot dispatch, execution is independent of the dispatching computer.

## Image contract

Build the image from a supported Windows 11 desktop base and include:

- an enabled interactive console desktop with RDP disabled;
- Codex CLI, Git, Git LFS, PowerShell 7, Bun, Node.js, Rust/Cargo, sccache,
  Visual Studio Build Tools, LLVM/libclang, CMake, Ninja, 7-Zip, jq, and FFmpeg;
- Screenpipe's autonomous bootstrap/worker/dispatcher, evidence recorder, and
  credential-isolated Codex launcher;
- long-path support and the machine environment expected by Screenpipe builds;
- a stable source path such as `C:\src\screenpipe` and a genuinely short
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` such as `C:\spdev`;
- warmed `debug-dev` Rust, native dependency, Bun, and sccache data produced by
  repository-supported build commands.

Discover and set `VCToolsRedistDir` during image construction when Build Tools
is installed outside its standard location. Merely redirecting a workspace
`target` directory does not prevent deep CMake/MSBuild paths from failing with
`MSB6003` or missing `.tlog` files; the effective Cargo target path must itself
be short.

Do not install or register a GitHub Actions runner. Do not bake API keys,
GitHub credentials, signing material, Azure-controller credentials, source
branches, passwords, or user data into the image. OpenAI and GitHub credentials
must be fetched only at runtime through managed identity and Key Vault.

## Build and publish an image version

Treat image construction as its own controlled infrastructure operation:

1. Build from the declared Windows 11 base with a versioned provisioning script.
2. Install the image contract and verify every tool from a fresh shell and an
   interactive desktop session.
3. Warm caches using a clean Screenpipe checkout at the stable source path, then
   remove repository credentials and task-specific source state.
4. Remove logs, temporary installers, tokens, credentials, machine-specific
   identifiers, and other provisioning residue.
5. Set the device `DisablePrivacyExperience` policy, then generalize the VM with
   Sysprep and a supported `oobeSystem` answer containing `HideEULAPage`,
   `HideOnlineAccountScreens`, `HideWirelessSetupInOOBE`,
   `HideOEMRegistrationScreen`, and `ProtectYourPC=3`. Do not use
   `SkipMachineOOBE`. Publish an immutable Compute Gallery image version and
   record its base version, provisioning commit, tool versions, and cache-warm
   commit as image metadata.
6. Launch a separate disposable VM from that exact image version. Dispatch an
   exact immutable autonomous visual smoke-task blob and verify the OOBE policy,
   runtime Codex authentication,
   console auto-logon, the supported native test, desktop recording, private
   evidence upload, credential cleanup, and shutdown. Verify TCP 3389 is not
   listening and the VM has no inbound NSG rule.
7. Mark the image version usable only after that fresh-VM smoke test passes.
   Never move a task to an unvalidated or partially built version.

Refresh the image deliberately when the Windows base, Visual Studio, Rust, Bun,
native dependencies, Codex, or Screenpipe build contract changes. Retain at
least one previously validated version for rollback. Image construction must not
read from, stop, modify, snapshot, or clone the live release builder.

## Per-task VM loop

For every Windows-native task:

1. Resolve and record the immutable validated image version.
2. The dispatcher creates a uniquely tagged disposable VM and its own OS disk,
   NIC, deny-inbound network controls, runtime managed identity, and shutdown
   fallback. It uploads one exact task blob plus the versioned runtime scripts,
   starts the bootstrap once, and exits without polling.
3. The VM starts from `C:\src\screenpipe`, replaces warmed source state with the
   exact requested Git revision, and verifies `git rev-parse HEAD` before work.
4. Run `bun run test:tauri <one-filter> -- --nocapture` for `src-tauri`; never
   run raw Cargo or Tauri commands there.
5. Redirect buffered Azure command output to a durable guest log, record an
   explicit native exit code, and preserve the tested SHA. Under strict
   PowerShell, isolate noisy native stderr so harmless banners do not become
   terminating errors.
6. The worker records its console desktop for visual or interactive acceptance.
   It uses a bounded recorder-readiness loop and keeps every local and uploaded
   evidence file isolated under the immutable task ID before delivery.
7. When the task authorizes delivery, the worker pushes, creates the PR, and
   adds a six-day read-only user-delegation SAS video link plus the exact tested
   commit and tree to the PR body. The lease stays within Azure's seven-day
   user-delegation limit and leaves clock-skew margin. The VM has no signing,
   release, or publication permission.
8. In `finally`, upload failure evidence, remove environment credentials and
   Codex auth state, disable auto-logon, and shut down. Delete the exact stopped
   VM resources later and verify absence; keep the shared immutable image.

If the image is missing, stale, or fails its fresh-VM smoke test, repair and
republish the image. Do not fall back to repeatedly provisioning a cold VM or
cloning the release runner.
